4Q Snapshot - Performance Exceeds Expectations
but High Discounting Again Brings Tail into Question

▼ Price Target: $116.00
Previous: $117.00

We are reiterating our OW rating on GILD following last night’s 4Q report that while
strong, wasn't without a curve ball (baseball analogy for those dreaming of spring
training). Namely, GILD’s expectation for the gross-to-net on HCV products to be
~46%, more than double the 22% at the end of 2014, caught just about everyone by
surprise. These discounts seem to be largely contingent on increased patient volumes
that should help offset the impact in the near term but again call into question the HCV
tail. The volume offset is highlighted by 2015 net product sales guidance of $26-27B
vs. our previous $26.7B estimate. Assuming patient volumes do in fact make up for
discounts (even if not completely), the bottom line is that GILD's HCV business will
still be a significant source of revenue and earnings growth as well as cash flow
generation. The key question in our minds remains how GILD leverages HCV into the
next phase of the company’s evolution. On that front GILD was clear that its newly
announced dividend and aggressive share repo program won’t impact its appetite for
BD/pipeline investment.
 Key update #1: 2015 HCV gross-to-net expected to be ~46%...prompting
emphasis on increased patient volumes. The more than doubling in discounting is
driven by both negotiations with payors and a higher % of public payor patients
(with rebates to Medicaid and the VA exceeding 50%). GILD emphasized this level
of discounting is designed to increase patient access and believes there is the
capacity to treat 250K+ pts (all genotypes) in the US in 2015. On payor negotiation
progress, GILD indicated ~60% of covered lives in the US have been negotiated,
and estimates 80% of these covered patients have access to GILD products. It also
indicated that it is confident that terms negotiated thus far will last through the year.

 Key update #2: GILD announces a $0.43/sh dividend and a new $15B buyback
program. After much debate/speculation on the issue, GILD will begin paying a
dividend equal to $1.72/sh annually, representing an ~1.6% yield. GILD intends to
grow it over time, but still views repurchases as the larger component of the capital
return strategy for the time being. Nevertheless, we expect this dividend to broaden
GILD’s investor base. There is ~$3B remaining under the current $5B repurchase
program (approved last May), and GILD announced a new $15B program (good for
5 yrs after completion of May’14 program). GILD reiterated the level at which it
repurchases shares has more to do with valuation (vs. targeting a specific payout
ratio).

 4Q14 Non-GAAP EPS of $2.43 was meaningfully ahead of JPMe/cons of
$2.23/$2.21. Total revenue of $7.3B was ahead of JPMe/Bloomberg cons of
$6.8B/$6.7B; 4Q total product sales of $7.2B were ahead of JPMe/cons of $6.7/$6.6B.
Sovaldi sales of $1.73B vs. JPMe of $1.94B and Harvoni sales of $2.1B vs. JPMe of
$1.57B. On Harvoni uptake, the co noted that 7 of 10 HCV pts initiating treatment in 4Q
started on Harvoni. Total non-GAAP OpEx was $2.5B vs. JPMe/company cons of
$2.2B. See the variance table on p.3 for more details.
 2015 product rev guidance brackets our previous estimate, highlighting the price
vs. volume relationship. GILD provided 2015 guidance for net product revs of $2627B vs. JPMe of $26.7B and a non-GAAP gross margin of 87-90% vs. JPMe of 88%.
On expenses, GILD guided to R&D expense of $3-3.3B, SG&A expense of $3-3.3B,
and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18-20% vs. JPMe of 19%.
 Updating model: We updated our model for 4Q results, 2015 guidance, and the
dividend. See the summary of key changes on p.4 for a more detailed overview. Overall,
the biggest changes to our model came from increased gross-to-net on HCV revenues
(to 46% from 22% in 2015), which was partially offset by increased patient volume
assumptions (we now assume ~220K pts treated in the US in 2015 vs. ~175K prvsly).
Our peak HCV sales estimate is now $15B in 2016 vs. 16.5B in 2017 prvsly. We also
increased expense assumptions in 2015 based on company guidance/commentary
around pipeline advancement. On valuation basis, the net effect of our changes was
relatively modest, and we are lowering our FY15 price target to $116 vs. $117.
 Balance sheet update. GILD ended 4Q with $11.7B in cash and investments and
~$13B in debt. During the quarter GILD generated $12.8B in operating cash flow, and
used $5.3B for share repurchases. Based on our updated model, we expect GILD to
generate ~$30B in cash over the next 3 years and ~$60B over the next 5 years. We
continue to believe this unprecedented CF generation in the biotech industry gives the
company significant strategic flexibility.

 Upcoming events: continued focus on HCV market dynamics, with HCV next-gen
regimen data updates coming at EASL. We expect HCV Rx trends, quarterly reports,
and payer updates will all continue to be significant drivers in 2015. Also in the HCV
world, we expect approval of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan in 1H15. On a pipeline
front, we should see some data from the 9857/5816/sof triple regimen for 4 or 6 weeks
in April at EASL (4/22-26, Vienna), and we anticipate top-line Phase 3 data from
5816/sof in 3Q15. We expect regulatory filings to expand Harvoni’s label into GT3 and
also look for the addition of the 12wk+RBV regimen for cirrhotic patients in 2H. In
HBV, we anticipate top-line Phase 1 data of GS-4774 in 1H15. In HIV, we expect
filings for F/TAF in 2Q and anticipate approval of E/C/F/TAF in the US in 4Q15. Topline data from simtuzumab in NASH and PFC is anticipated in 4Q15.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Gilead Sciences (Overweight; Price Target: $116.00)
Investment Thesis
We have an OW rating on GILD. In 2015, we expect focus will largely remain on
HCV market dynamics, and we think clarity on pricing/competition will contribute to
near-term upside while 1) giving GILD’s pipeline time to mature and 2) facilitate
acquisitions/further pipeline investment, which we believe will give greater
confidence in outer-year revenues leading to further appreciation in GILD shares.
Additionally, GILD has several drug candidates to watch in its pipeline, including
products in potential key (large) markets such as HBV and RSV.
Valuation
Our YE15 price target for GILD is $116. Our DCF-based valuation assumes a 10%
discount rate and a 1% terminal growth rate. Our price target calculates the terminal
value off of 2022; however, it’s important to note that, not surprisingly, there is
sensitivity around the terminal value year. This issue highlights the importance of the
“what’s next” question given the anticipated y-o-y decrease in free cash flow in the
outer years. In our opinion, it’s difficult to value GILD based on a P/E multiple given
the potential lumpiness in future earnings.

Risks to Rating and Price Target
Key downside risks include 1) commercial risk to the HIV franchise, 2) failure of

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire
period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is
compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear
in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst’s coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan’s research
website, www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
