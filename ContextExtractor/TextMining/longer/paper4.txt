Derivative Comments from GILD's 4Q14 Call for ENTA and ACHN

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
GILD views the HCV market

GILD’s HCV comments imply some downside potential to our 2015 HCV market estimates and

as sustainable over the next

ENTA revenue forecast; GILD views the HCV market as sustainable over the next 10-15+ years;

10-15+ years; next-gen

next-gen shortened duration combo data expected at EASL. Gilead (GILD, NC) surprised investors

shortened duration combo data

with its 46% gross/net adjustment estimate for its HCV franchise in 2015 vs. our 20-25% estimate where

expected at EASL

the difference is driven by recent negotiated contracts with PBMs and further suppressed by Medicaid
and VA rebates. However, GILD expects far fewer access restrictions going forward and sees capacity of
>250K patients in 2015 vs. our estimated ~255K patients treated in the US. Assuming a slightly higher
G/N adjustment for AbbVie (ABBV, NC) / Enanta's (ENTA, MP) Viekira Pak implies downside potential to
our $1.7B US estimate ($2.1B global sales), which potentially could be offset by more patients treated vs.
our model. GILD sees the EU HCV market as potentially larger than the US at steady state, potentially
suggesting upside to our current estimates. In-line with our thinking, GILD views the global HCV market as
sustainable over 10-15+ years. Separately, initial data for GILD’s next-gen triple combo evaluating fourand six-week regimen should be available at the European liver meeting (EASL) in April, which could
set a new benchmark for next-generation competition, and a decision on whether to advance this combo
into a Phase 3 study is expected to be made in 2H15; top-line data for a 12-week Phase 3 study of pangenotypic Sof/GS-5816 regimen should be available in 3Q15.
