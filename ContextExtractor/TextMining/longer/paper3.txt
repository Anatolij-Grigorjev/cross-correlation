Our risk assessment reflects Gilead's progress
toward diversifying its business and easing
reliance on its HIV drug franchise for near-term
revenue growth, which we see as subject to
pricing and reimbursement sensitivity, and some
patent expirations late in the decade. We see
new growth opportunities in hepatitis C and
oncology emerging as potential long-term growth
drivers.

Analysis prepared by Equity Analyst Jeffrey Loo, CFA on Feb 03, 2015 06:34 PM, when the stock traded at $107.18.

Highlights
➤

➤

➤

We estimate 2015 sales increasing 10.9% to
$27.6 billion, driven by GILD's hepatitis C (HCV)
franchise of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni, a
fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Our forecast is slightly above GILD's
guidance of $26.0 billion to $27.0 billion, that we
see as conservative, in spite of competition and
larger discounts in 2015. GILD estimates a 46%
gross-to-net adjustment for its HCV franchise,
compared to 22% at the end of 2014. In 2014,
170K patients were treated with GILD's HCV
drugs and it estimates up to 250K patients treated in 2015, driven by expanded patient access
in the U.S and in Europe as more reimbursement agreements have been reached. Although
we think the AbbVie and Express Scripts deal
with AbbVie's Viekira Pak as the exclusive
genotype 1 HCV drug on Express Script's formulary raises some uncertainty on sales, we
see GILD maintaining a dominant market share.
We also continue to view favorably GILD's
leading U.S. HIV drug market share.
We see gross margin of 90% and operating
margins of 68.3% in 2015, up from 66.6% in 2014.
We see EPS of $9.56 in 2015.

Investment Rationale/Risk
➤

➤

➤

In spite of recent share volatility due to competition from AbbVie's recently approved HCV
drug, Viekira, and exclusive deal with Express
Scripts, we expect GILD's HCV program to
maintain a dominant market position. We believe AbbVie will likely obtain a 20% market
share in HCV, but we believe Harvoni is the
physician's preferred choice due to significantly easier compliance as Viekira requires 4-6
pills with dosing more than once a day. We also
believe Harvoni's clinical data is superior with
the FDA labeling requiring Viekira to be taken
with ribavirin for genotype 1 treatment-naive,
non-cirrhotic patients. We also believe many
patients will be eligible for an eight-week treatment regimen of Harvoni, which would eliminate Viekira's price advantage. With GILD's
shares trading at 11.1X our 2015 EPS estimate,
well below peers and historical levels, we believe the shares are attractively valued.
Risks to our recommendation and target price
include a significant slowdown in Sovaldi sales.
Our 12-month target price of $143 is 15.0X our
2015 EPS estimate, and reflecting a 0.75X PEG
multiple, well below peers.

Stock Report | February 3, 2015 | NNM Symbol: GILD

Gilead Sciences Inc
Business Summary February 03, 2015
CORPORATE OVERVIEW. Gilead Sciences (GILD) focuses on the research, development, and marketing of
anti-infective medications, with a primary focus on treatments for HIV.
GILD has a leading market position in treating HIV virus. Truvada, approved in 2004, is a once-daily combination tablet formulated with previous-generation drugs Viread and Emtriva. Viread was approved in 2001.
Truvada generated 2013 sales of $3.136 billion, slightly below 2012 sales of $3.18 billion. Viread is also used
for treating hepatitis B, and saw 13% sales growth to $959 million in 2013 from $849 million in 2012. In 2006,
GILD and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) launched Atripla, a combination tablet with Truvada and BMY's
Sustiva. Atripla generated 2013 sales of $3.65 billion up 2% from 2012 sales of $3.58 billion. Atripla received
EU approval in December 2007.
More recently, Complera (U.S.) and Eviplera (Europe), comprised of Truvada and Tibotec's Edurant
(rilpivirine), were approved in 2011, and generated $809 million in 2013 sales, up significantly from $342 million in 2012 sales. In August 2012, the FDA approved GILD's wholly owned "Quad Pill," marketed as Stribild,
which combines investigational agents elvitegravir, and HIV-boosting agent cobicistat, with Truvada in patients new to HIV treatment. In Phase III study, Stribild showed non-inferiority to Atripla, with a favorable
side effect profile. In May 2013, Stribild was approved in the European Union. Stribild saw sales of $539
million in 2013 compared to initial sales of $58 million in 2012.
Hepsera, approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the U.S. and EU, saw sales decline to $81 million
in 2013 following the 25% decline in 2012, to $108 million. AmBisome B, an antifungal agent that is approved
for life-threatening fungal infections including cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients, generated sales
of $352 million in 2013, up slightly from the $348 million in 2012. Tamiflu, an orally administered treatment for
influenza A and B, is marketed by Roche, which pays GILD a 21%-22% royalty. Tamiflu's patents expire at
the end of 2016.
In October 2006, GILD purchased Myogen for $2.5 billion for rights to Letairis, a once-daily treatment for
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which was approved in June 2007. In 2013, Letairis generated $520
million in sales, up 27% from the $410 million in sales in 2012. In 2009, GILD purchased CV Therapeutics for
its lead drug Ranexa for chronic angina. Ranexa generated 2013 sales of $449 million, up 20% from the $373
million in sales in 2012. Cayston (aztreonam lysine), an inhaled medicine for cystic fibrosis, was approved
by the FDA in February 2010 and is conditionally approved in Europe, with final approval conditional upon
completion of an ongoing study.
PIPELINE. GILD is advancing a pipeline for hepatitis C, centered around Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), acquired from
Pharmasset. The drug secured FDA approval in December 2013 for genotypes 1 and 4 (12 weeks, with interferon/ribavirin), genotype 2 (12 weeks, with ribavirin), genotype 3 (24 weeks, with ribavirin). In addition,
the FDA allowed Sovaldi/ribavirin to be considered in patients intolerant to interferon in a 24-week regimen. In October 2014, GILD received FDA approval for Harvoni (Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir), the first once-daily
single tablet regimen for the treatment of Hepatitis C for genotype 1, which accounts for about 75% of U.S
patients, without the use of interferon and ribavirin. Harvoni achieved cure rates (SVR12) of 94%-99% in
three Phase III clinical trials.
In HIV, GILD is in Phase III study on tenofovir alafenamide (GS-7340), which has a more potent profile than
current therapy backbone tenofovir (Viread) in smaller doses, thereby reducing toxicity. In October 2012,
GS-7340 met its primary endpoint of similar virologic response versus GILD's Stribild, with favorable bone
mineral density and serum creatinine outcomes. In April 2011, GILD acquired privately held Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million to add pipeline candidates in oncology and inflammation. Lead candidate Zydelig (idelalisib) was approved by the FDA in late July 2014 for for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and
indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). European accelerated approval for iNHL, and for CLL is pending.
In January 2011, GILD acquired privately held Arresto Biosciences for $225 million for early-stage treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and advanced solid tumors. In February 2013, GILD acquired YM
Biosciences, a developer of drugs for cancer and inflammatory disorders in a $510 million deal. YM's lead
candidate CYT387 has completed Phase I/II study for blood disorder myelofibrosis.
FINANCIAL TRENDS. In 2013, total revenues rose 15.5% to $11.2 billion, from $9.7 billion in 2012. At September 30, 2014, GILD had $7.7 billion of cash and securities and $9.5 billion of long-term debt. The company issued $6 billion of new debt to acquire Pharmasset in January 2012. Since January 2010, GILD has repurchased roughly 169.9 million of its shares for $6.65 billion (including 5.743 million shares repurchased in Q1
2014 for $450 million). GILD commenced a new $5 billion program in 2011, but deferred its program to reduce debt following the Pharmasset acquisition. In July 2013, GILD resumed its repurchase program and in
July 2014, it announced a new $5 billion program.

Gilead Sciences Inc
Sub-Industry Outlook

Industry Performance

Our positive fundamental outlook for the
biotechnology sub-industry for the next 12 months
reflects favorable prospects for new and novel
therapies to reach commercialization. We are
encouraged by what we view as a strong period for
the reporting of late-stage clinical results, and a
more accommodating U.S. FDA for approvals.
Although the FDA approved 27 new therapies in
2013, down from 39 in 2012, we think many of these
newly approved drugs have significant commercial
prospects and represent major advances in
therapeutic areas such as hepatitis C, multiple
sclerosis and cancer. We expect wider adoption of
biomarker research and genetic-targeted clinical
studies to help bolster long-term R&D pipeline
productivity. In late 2012, the FDA introduced
"breakthrough therapy" designations, intended to
speed development of promising programs, and
granted this designation 35 times, and has approved
three drugs with this status as of May 2014.

GICS Sector: Health Care
Sub-Industry: Biotechnology

clarity. Once marketed, we expect biosimilars to sell
at more modest price discounts than in the
pharmaceutical industry due to higher clinical,
manufacturing and marketing costs, and we expect
branded drugs to retain significant market share due
to a lack of interchangeability among these options.

Based on S&P 1500 Indexes
Five-Year market price performance through
Feb 3, 2015

We recommend that investors concentrate core
holdings in established, profitable companies, as
smaller biotechs tend to be more volatile. We would
seek companies with at least two years of operating
capital and multiple pipeline value drivers, as those
with smaller pipelines typically suffer significant
share price declines on an unfavorable outcome.

We expect a favorable M&A (mergers and
acquisitions) climate, as large pharmaceutical firms
move to offset lost revenues from expiring drug
patents and large biotechs bolster their drug
pipelines amid maturing products. We note an
uptick in M&A speculation and announced deals
recently after a subdued first half of 2013. We also
see large cap biotechs generating cash flows
supporting larger scale acquisitions of their own. In
2011, industry bellwether Amgen became the first
biotech company to initiate a regular dividend.

The 2010 health care reform law established the

advancing at a slower rate than initially anticipated.
Several firms have abandoned biosimilar plans due
to high development costs and a lack of regulatory

S&P Capital IQ Analyst Research Notes and other Company News
February 3, 2015
06:14 pm ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES
OF GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD 107.18*****): We raise our 12-month target $8 to $143
on below peers 15X our '15 EPS estimate. Q4 EPS of $2.43 vs. $0.55 is $0.03 ahead
of our estimate. Sovaldi and Harvoni sales of $3.8B. In '14, 170K patients were
treated with Sovaldi or Harvoni and GILD sees up to 250K patients treated in '15.
But GILD estimates a 46% gross-to-net adjustment, more than double the 22% in
'14, indicating larger discounts. GILD guides, '15 sales of $26.0B-$27.0B that we
view as conservative, in spite of competition and higher rebates. GILD initiates
$0.43 quarterly dividend and announces a $15B stock buyback. /Jeffrey Loo, CFA
January 5, 2015
02:21 pm ET ... S&P REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF GILEAD
SCIENCES (GILD 97.28*****): CVS Health (CVS 95 ****) announced it has given
GILD's hepatitis C (HCV) drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni exclusivity on its formularies.
This follows AbbVie's (ABBV 64 ***) exclusive deal with Express Scripts, for its
recently approved HCV drug, Viekira. We are not surprised by the CVS/GILD deal
and believe it removes some investor concern over a potential ABBV/CVS deal.
The companies have not disclosed a pricing discount, but we believe GILD will
provide a discount. Express Scripts and CVS are the 2 largest PBMs in the U.S.,
respectively, and we do not see any more exclusive deals. /Jeffrey Loo, CFA
December 22, 2014
11:15 am ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ MAINTAINS STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES
OF GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD 94.85*****): The FDA approved AbbVie's (ABBV 67
***) hepatitis C (HCV) drug, Viekira Pak, that will compete with GILD's HCV drugs.
ABBV priced Viekira Pak at $83,319, below Sovaldi and Harvoni. FDA approval
was expected, but more importantly, ABBV entered into an exclusive deal with
Express Scripts, which includes a "significant discount" with Viekira Pak as the
exclusive HCV drug, excluding GILD"s drugs. We believe this unprecedented deal
will hurt GILD sales by at least $1B in 2015. We lower our 12-mo. target $15 to
$135 on below-peers 15X our '15 EPS est. of $9.00, down from $9.65. /gcc_support
December 22, 2014
11:15 am ET ... CORRECTION - S&P CAPITAL IQ KEEP STRONG BUY OPINION ON
SHARES OF GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD 94.85*****): Corrected analyst tag. The FDA
approved AbbVie's (ABBV 67 ***) hepatitis C (HCV) drug, Viekira Pak, that will
compete with GILD's HCV drugs. ABBV priced Viekira Pak at $83,319, below
Sovaldi and Harvoni. ABBV entered into an exclusive deal with Express Scripts,
which includes a "significant discount" with Viekira Pak as the exclusive HCV
drug, excluding GILD"s drugs. We believe this unprecedented deal will hurt GILD
sales by at least $1B in 2015. We lower our 12-mo. target $15 to $135 on
below-peers 15X our '15 EPS est. of $9.00, down from $9.65. /Jeffrey Loo, CFA
October 28, 2014
05:52 pm ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES
OF GILEAD SCIENCES INC. (GILD 113.45*****): We lower our '14 EPS est. $0.51 to
$8.29 but keep our 12-mo. target at $150 on below peers 15.6X our forward 12-mo.
EPS est. of $9.58. Q3 adj. EPS of $2.05 vs. $0.52 is $0.41 below our est. Sovaldi
sales of $2.8B was robust but below our $3.4B forecast due to patient delays in
anticipation of FDA approval of Harvoni. But we see a re-acceleration of hepatitis
C sales driven by Harvoni in Q4 and '15. GILD indicated the Harvoni launch is
proceeding well with a broader group of physicians prescribing it, a faster rate of
adoption, and the potential for an 8-week treatment regimen. /Jeffrey Loo, CFA
October 10, 2014
02:23 pm ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES
OF GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD 105.92*****): The FDA approved GILD's Sovaldi +
Ledipasvir (Harvoni) pill to treat genotype 1 hepatitis C (HCV) patients, with
treatment duration of 8, 12 or 24 weeks. Harvoni is the first combination pill
approved to treat genotype 1 HCV patients and is the first regimen that does not
require interferon or ribavirin. We expect Harvoni, with cure rates of between
94%-99% to command a dominant market position. But we note continued pricing
controversy. Although GILD has not disclosed pricing, we anticipate Harvoni to
be priced around $95K for 12-weeks. We also anticipate EU approval shortly.
/Jeffrey Loo, CFA
September 15, 2014
03:28 pm ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES
OF GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD 101.22*****): GILD announced a deal with 7 Indian
Redistribution or reproduction is prohibited without written permission.

generic drug firms that enables these firms to sell Sovaldi at a much lower cost
than the $84,000 GILD charges for a 12-week regimen in the U.S. The deal covers
91 developing countries, where more than 100 million people have hepatitis C, but
excludes many of the larger more developed countries such as China and Brazil.
GILD plans to price its own branded Sovaldi in India for $10 a pill or $300/month,
so we expect generics to be priced lower. Separately, GILD provided a glimpse of
the potential pricing for Sovalid/Ledipasvir at about $95,000. /Jeffrey Loo, CFA
July 24, 2014
08:29 am ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES
OF GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD 90.34*****): We raise our target price $20 to $150 on
below peers 17X our '14 EPS est. of $8.80, up from $4.94 and PEG of 0.45X. Q2 adj.
EPS of $2.36 vs. $0.50 is $1.20 above our est. Robust Sovaldi sales of $3.5B easily
beat our $2.8B forecast as payer reimbursement expands amid continued calls to
lowering its price. Only 3 states now do not provide Medicaid reimbursement for
Sovaldi. GILD stated they have seen evidence of some patient warehousing in
anticipation of its Sovaldi/Ledipasvir's Oct. 10 FDA action date, but we believe
potential impact to be immaterial as demand remains robust. /Jeffrey Loo, CFA
June 9, 2014
10:52 am ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ MAINTAINS STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES
OF GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD 79.29*****): GILD shares are lower following news of
Merck (MRK 58, ***) agreeing to acquire Idenix (IDIX 24, NR) for $3.85B. IDIX has
a portfolio of hepatitis C (HCV) compounds based on nucleoside/nucleotide
chemistry similar to GILD's Sovaldi. MRK believes a combination of two of its HCV
compounds MK-5127 and MK-8742 along with one of IDIX's HCV compounds,
including IDX 21437, could create a potent drug to cure all strains of HCV in as
little as four weeks. But we believe any potential successful MRK and IDIX drug
combination is several years away and GILD's share decline is unwarranted.
/Jeffrey Loo, CFA
June 9, 2014
10:41 am ET ... S&P CAPITAL IQ MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF
MERCK (MRK 57.77***): MRK agrees to buy Idenix (IDIX 24 NR) for $24.50/share
or $3.9B. The deal, subject to approvals, is expected to close in Q3 14. IDIX has a
portfolio of Hepatitis C (HCV) candidates based on nucleoside/nucleotide
chemistry. MRK believes a combination of its HCV candidates MK-5172 and
MK-8742 with one of IDIX's compounds can offer a potent drug to cure all strains
of HCV in as little as 4 weeks. IDIX's main drug, IDX 21437, works similar to Gilead
Science's (GILD 80 *****) HCV drug Sovaldi. But we note toxicity levels in
nucleosides/nucleotides are high and challenging to produce. /Jeffrey Loo, CFA

Glossary
S&P Capital IQ STARS
Since January 1, 1987, S&P Capital IQ Equity Research has ranked a universe of U.S.
common stocks, ADRs (American Depositary Receipts), and ADSs (American
Depositary Shares) based on a given equity's potential for future performance.
Similarly, S&P Capital IQ Equity Research has ranked Asian and European equities
since June 30, 2002. Under proprietary STARS (STock Appreciation Ranking System),
S&P Capital IQ equity analysts rank equities according to their individual forecast of an
equity's future total return potential versus the expected total return of a relevant
benchmark (e.g., a regional index (S&P Asia 50 Index, S&P Europe 350® Index or
S&P 500® Index)), based on a 12-month time horizon. STARS was designed to meet
the needs of investors looking to put their investment decisions in perspective. Data
used to assist in determining the STARS ranking may be the result of the analyst's
own models as well as internal proprietary models resulting from dynamic data inputs.

S&P Capital IQ Quality Ranking
(also known as S&P Capital IQ Earnings & Dividend Rankings) - Growth and
stability of earnings and dividends are deemed key elements in establishing S&P
Capital IQ's earnings and dividend rankings for common stocks, which are designed to
capsulize the nature of this record in a single symbol. It should be noted, however, that
the process also takes into consideration certain adjustments and modifications
deemed desirable in establishing such rankings. The final score for each stock is
measured against a scoring matrix determined by analysis of the scores of a large and
representative sample of stocks. The range of scores in the array of this sample has
been aligned with the following ladder of rankings:
A+ Highest
B Below Average

B- Lower
A- Above Average
C Lowest

S&P Capital IQ EPS Estimates
S&P Capital IQ earnings per share (EPS) estimates reflect analyst projections of future
EPS from continuing operations, and generally exclude various items that are viewed
as special, non-recurring, or extraordinary. Also, S&P Capital IQ EPS estimates reflect
either forecasts of S&P Capital IQ equity analysts; or, the consensus (average) EPS
estimate, which are independently compiled by Capital IQ, a data provider to S&P
Capital IQ Equity Research. Among the items typically excluded from EPS estimates
are asset sale gains; impairment, restructuring or merger-related charges; legal and
insurance settlements; in process research and development expenses; gains or
losses on the extinguishment of debt; the cumulative effect of accounting changes;
and earnings related to operations that have been classified by the company as
discontinued. The inclusion of some items, such as stock option expense and
recurring types of other charges, may vary, and depend on such factors as industry
practice, analyst judgment, and the extent to which some types of data is disclosed by
companies.

S&P Capital IQ Core Earnings
S&P Capital IQ Core Earnings is a uniform methodology for adjusting operating
earnings by focusing on a company's after-tax earnings generated from its principal
businesses. Included in the S&P Capital IQ definition are employee stock option grant
expenses, pension costs, restructuring charges from ongoing operations, write-downs
of depreciable or amortizable operating assets, purchased research and development,
M&A related expenses and unrealized gains/losses from hedging activities. Excluded
from the definition are pension gains, impairment of goodwill charges, gains or losses
from asset sales, reversal of prior-year charges and provision from litigation or
insurance settlements.

S&P Capital IQ Qualitative Risk Assessment
Reflects an S&P Capital IQ equity analyst's view of a given company's operational risk,
or the risk of a firm's ability to continue as an ongoing concern. The S&P Capital IQ
Qualitative Risk Assessment is a relative ranking to the S&P U.S. STARS universe,
and should be reflective of risk factors related to a company's operations, as opposed
to risk and volatility measures associated with share prices. For an ETF this reflects on
a capitalization-weighted basis, the average qualitative risk assessment assigned to
holdings of the fund.
