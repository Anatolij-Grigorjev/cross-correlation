GILD reported Q4:14 HCV sales ahead of consensus, and provided 2015 product sales
guidance generally in line with expectations. Management's gross to net commentary
implies larger discounts in 2015 than anticipated, which we expect will stoke investors'
fears about price competition and the longevity of the U.S. patient bolus. We continue
to believe GILD is undervalued and maintain our $125 PT.

GILD guided to 2015 product sales of $26B-$27B, and non-GAAP gross margins
of 87%-90%. With expectations for 2015 non-HCV product sales at about $13B,
guidance therefore implies 2015 HCV worldwide sales of $13B - $14B, which we think
is generally in line with prior expectations. Prior GM consensus was 87.6%. Notably,
Gilead expects the U.S. gross to net adjustment on HCV sales to increase from 22%
in 2014 to 46% in 2015. Management indicated that the increase is due to public
payors (Medicaid, VA, etc) making up a larger percentage of the mix in 2015, as well
as larger discounts being negotiated with private payors. Gilead said that private
payors' discounts are correlated to market access, meaning that payors with fewer
restrictions in their formulary will be granted a larger discount. In fact, with improving
market access, GILD projects there could be as many as 250K HCV patients treated
in the U.S. in 2015. Unfortunately, GILD investors have two major concerns: HCV price
competition, and the longevity of the HCV patient bolus. We expect this commentary
to stoke both fears as investors will worry that discounts will continue to increase as
more players enter the HCV market, and that the diagnosed U.S. patient population
will be treated more quickly.
While the net price in the U.S. market is less than we anticipated, ex-US volumes
are increasing more quickly, and these effects largely offset. We have cut our 2015
U.S. GT 1 price from $60K to $48K, and our GT2/3 price from $84K to $52K. We have
modestly increased our share assumptions, but our 2015 U.S. estimate has decreased
from $12.8B to $10B. Our ex-U.S. pricing assumptions have remained the same (~
$40K-50K), but now we project GILD will treat 93K patients ex-U.S., while we had
projected 46K. Our ex-U.S. HCV est has increased from $2.2B to $4.5B. Our 2015 HCV
est has decreased from $15B to $14.5B, although our 2016-2019 ests are unchanged.

At A Glance
Our Investment Thesis

Forthcoming Catalysts

We believe Sovaldi will be the cornerstone of future all-oral HCV combos. Sovaldi
was launched in the U.S. in December 2013, and we project Gilead’s HCV franchise
will achieve $18B in worldwide sales by 2019. We expect that through a combination
of HIV market growth, share gains, and price increases, GILD's HIV franchise will
continue to grow at least in line with our projections for a 2% CAGR during 2014-19E.
We expect GILD to outperform the market over the next 12 months as Gilead's HIV
franchise continues to grow, the HCV franchise's launch progresses, and consensus
estimates continue to increase.

Gilead’s revenue growth over the next several years will be driven by its HCV
portfolio. That franchise is led by Sovaldi, a nucleoside inhibitor for the treatment
of HCV. Results from Sovaldi’s Phase III trials have shown it to be potent and well
tolerated with a high barrier to viral resistance and we expect it to achieve $18B
in revenue by 2019. Gilead’s leading HIV franchise is anchored by Viread, a welltolerated, efficacious, 1x/daily nucleotide analog that posted 2014 (13th year) sales
of $1.1B. Gilead has developed several Viread-based combination pills including
Truvada, Atripla, Complera and Stribild which together have captured >90% share of
treatment-naive HIV patients, driving HIV franchise revenue to $10.0B in 2014.

GILD Declared Dividend, Remains Committed To Returning Cash To
Shareholders.
GILD's board has authorized a $0.43 quarterly dividend, equating to an approximate
1.6% - 1.7% dividend yield. GILD's board has further authorized a $15B share buyback,
in addition to the ongoing $5B buyback (of which $3B is remaining). GILD noted that
it has been returning about 50% of its cashflow to shareholders in recent years, and
management remains committed to maintaining a similar level in the future.
Pipeline Update.
Gilead continues to research Harvoni's utility in special patient populations.
Data from ongoing studies in HIV coinfected and advanced liver disease patients
will report data in 2015 (likely at EASL). Gilead's pan-genotypic HCV therapy
(GS-5816+Sofosbuvir) will report Ph3 data in H2:15. Management believes a 3DAA regimen (GS-9857+GS-5816+Sofosbuvir) could further shorten treatment
durations. Data from the 4 and 6-week treatment arms of Ph2 trails using this regimen
will be presented at EASL. The first NDA for TAF has been granted a PDUFA date of
November 5, 2015. Gilead's Hepatitis B program will report data from Phase 2 trials of
GS-4774 and GS-9620 in H1:15 and H2:15 respectively. Outside of virology, Gilead
disclosed that simtuzumab failed to produce signs of efficacy in a Ph2 myelofibrosis
trial. Simtuzumab's potentially pivotal Ph2 NASH data is expected in H2:15. Ph2
simtuzumab data in PSC is also expected by YE. GS-5745 (anti-MMP9 mAb) will
be advanced into Ph2 trials for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC) and gastric
cancer (GC) following encouraging Ph1 data in UC and GC. In 2015, GS-4997 (ASK1
inhibitor) will be advanced into Ph2 for NASH. The recently acquired FXR inhibitor
from Phenex will also begin a Ph1 NASH trial.

Investment Thesis
Gilead develops and markets treatments for HIV, HBV, HCV, and fungal infections.
Gilead’s revenue growth over the next several years will be driven by its HCV portfolio.
That franchise is led by Sovaldi, a nucleoside inhibitor for the treatment of HCV.
Results from Sovaldi’s Phase III trials have shown it to be potent and well tolerated
with a high barrier to viral resistance. We believe these data suggest Sovaldi is set to
be the cornerstone of future all-oral HCV combos. Sovaldi was launched in the U.S. in
December 2013 and in the EU in January 2014. The HCV franchise is off to a fast start
as it posted >$12.3B in revenue its first full year. Despite emerging competition and
pushback from payors, we think GILD’s HCV franchise will be $18B at peak. Gilead’s
leading HIV franchise is anchored by Viread, a well-tolerated, efficacious, 1x/daily
nucleotide analog that posted 2014 (13th year) sales of $1.1B. Gilead’s first fixed-dose
co-formulation of Emtriva and Viread, Truvada, achieved 2014 sales of $3.3B. A fixed
dose 3-in-1 formulation of Viread, Emtriva, and Bristol’s NNRTI Sustiva has further
solidified GILD’s HIV franchise and drove total franchise revenue to >$10.3B in 2014.
We expect future growth of Gilead’s HIV franchise will be in part driven by two new
Truvada-based combo pills, Complera and Stribild. Complera was launched during
H2:11, while Stribild was launched following its August 2012 approval. We project the
two will achieve combined sales of $6.9B by 2019. In September 2014 GILD released
results from Phase III trials of Viread follow-on, TAF, which demonstrated an improved
kidney and bone profile. We expect GILD will switch a meaningful percentage of its
HIV franchise onto TAF-based regimens before Viread's patents expire, extending the
franchise's commercial life. We expect that through a combination of HIV market
growth, share gains, launches of the new combo pills, and price increases, GILD’s HIV
franchise will continue to grow at least in line with our projections for 2% franchise
growth during 2014-19E, despite Viread's 2018 patent expiration. We expect GILD to
outperform the market over the next 12 months as Gilead's HIV franchise continues to
grow, the HCV franchise launch outpaces expectations, and consensus estimates
continue to increase.

Valuation Methodology And Risks
Valuation Methodology
Biotechnology:
In calculating our 12-month target price, we employ one or more valuation
methodologies, which include a discounted earnings analysis, discounted cash flow
analysis, net present value analysis and/or a comparable company analysis. These
analyses may or may not require the use of objective measures such as price-toearnings or price-to-sales multiples as well as subjective measures such as discount
rates.
We make investment recommendations on early stage (pre-commercial)
biotechnology companies based upon an assessment of their technology, the
probability of pipeline success, and the potential market opportunity in the event of
success. However, because these companies lack traditional financial metrics, we do
not believe there are any good methodologies for assigning a specific target price to
such stocks.

Investment Risks
Biotechnology:
There are multiple risks that are inherent with an investment in the biotechnology
sector. Beyond systemic risk, there is also clinical, regulatory, and commercial risk.
Additionally, biotechnology companies require significant amounts of capital in order
to develop their clinical programs. The capital-raising environment is always changing
and there is risk that necessary capital to complete development may not be readily
available.

Risks To The Price Target
Gilead develops and commercializes drugs for a number of indications, including
HIV, HCV, HBV, influenza, cancer, and pulmonary hypertension. Forecasting sales
for any product is difficult, as the outlook could be altered by new safety/efficacy
findings, emerging competition, alterations in the medical treatment paradigm, or
changes in the pricing/reimbursement environment. Gilead's stock price could also
be impacted by the changes in the outlook for key pipeline programs, most notably
Sovaldi, ledipasvir, and idelalisib. Evaluating the market potential for drugs that have
not yet been approved is particularly risky. Moreover, the market exclusivity for most
of Gilead's franchises depends on patents, which are subject to challenge by generic
drugmakers. The value of Gilead's franchises could be diminished should they lose the
protection of key patents.
