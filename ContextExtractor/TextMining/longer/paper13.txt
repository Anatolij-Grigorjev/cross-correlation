Strong Fourth-Quarter Operating Results; Expect an Active Pipeline
Year in 2015
After the markets closed on Tuesday, February 3, Gilead reported fourth-quarter
operating results that were highlighted by strong overall performance of key products.
Notably, sales of HCV drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni were $3.8 billion, just ahead of our
expectations of $3.5 billion. Exhibit 1 provides a variance analysis of the company’s
operating results compared with our estimates. Management also provided 2015
financial guidance, which takes into account the anticipated effects of shortened therapy
duration and price discounts with the HCV franchise. We illustrate 2015 guidance in
exhibit 2 along with our modified financial estimates.
Key Conclusions Following Management’s Call With Investors Include:
•

•

Overall key product performance was very strong in the quarter. As indicated in
our variance analysis, we are encouraged by the overall performance of key products.
In particular, the HIV franchise continues to provide a consistent revenue stream. We
expect positive operating momentum to continue into 2015 and note from our
experience that management historically gives conservative guidance on its year-end
call.
2015 stands to be an active pipeline year highlighted by Phase III readouts with
sofosbuvir in combination with GS-5816 in HCV genotypes 1-6. We expect 2015
to be a highly visible year for Gilead’s HCV franchise, and we anticipate top-line data
from four Phase III trials, which assess the combination of sofosbuvir plus GS-5816, a
pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor (formulated in a single-tablet regimen), for the
treatment of all HCV genotypes. We believe that the company’s pan-genotypic
regimen could have the potential to address a broader patient population compared
with Harvoni, eliminating the need to screen patients for the specific genotype.
Consistent with past years, we believe Gilead will be extremely active at the two
primary HCV conferences, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)
in April and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
meeting in November, and we anticipate further clinical updates from the pipeline at
these venues. Accordingly, exhibit 3 outlines the GS-5816 Phase III program, while
exhibit 4 provides our expectation for upcoming clinical and regulatory catalysts.
In parallel, Gilead continues to push initiatives that have the potential to further
shorten treatment duration. Phase II studies with sofosbuvir in combination with GS5816 and GS-9857, which is a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor, are being explored as
4- to 6-week treatment regimens targeting patients who are treatmentnaïve/treatment-experienced as well as with or without cirrhosis. We expect the
Phase II top-line results will likely read out at EASL in April.

Gilead is a research-based biotechnology company focused on developing therapies for the treatment
of life-threatening diseases. Gilead has been a leader in HIV/AIDS therapeutics and more recently in
HCV, but also has a large product portfolio that includes therapeutics for liver, cardiovascular,

•

Capital allocation and balance sheet considerations: Gilead announces a $0.43 quarterly dividend and a five-year,
$15 billion share-buyback program. Gilead generated operating cash flow of $12.8 billion during 2014, and we highlight
the $2.0 billion share repurchase during the fourth quarter. We have received a considerable number of questions over
the past year regarding Gilead’s strategy for capital redeployment. While we continue to expect the company to pursue
strategic acquisitions and licensing transactions, robust cash flows and a growing balance sheet enabled the company to
offer shareholders a $1.72 annual cash dividend program beginning in the second quarter of this year. In addition, we
expect management to continue to repurchase shares as evidenced by the $15 billion share repurchase authorization that
will commence upon the completion of the existing May 2014 program ($3 billion remaining). Cash and marketable
securities at the end of the quarter were $11.7 billion.

•

Our thoughts on the stock remain unchanged, and we reiterate our Outperform rating on Gilead shares. With the
launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni, we believe Gilead is in the early stages of contributing meaningfully to a major global
public health problem. Combined with strong underlying core global infrastructure in HIV and cardiopulmonary disease
and advancement into the oncology setting, we view the company as poised for a multiyear period of growth and cash
flow generation significantly ahead of its peers. Share price weakness in the aftermarket was likely attributable to
discussion surrounding price discounting, which we believe is 1) in line with expectations for a competitive market with
shortening duration of therapy and 2) considered within the financial guidance framework provided by management.
Based on our revised estimates, the company is trading at 11.2 times our projected EPS in 2015 and a PE/G ratio of 1.0; we
reiterate our Outperform rating on GILD shares.

William Blair & Company, L.L.C.
Valuation
Gilead is trading at 11.2 times our updated adjusted EPS estimate for 2015 of $9.55. We believe that Gilead has extensive
expertise in drug discovery, development, and commercialization. The company has also been extremely active relative to its
peers in strategic development. We see strong growth potential driven by greater confidence in HIV market growth, the
potential of the HCV and oncology franchises, and accretive revenues from new products, such as Letairis, Ranexa, and other
late-stage products. Based on our favorable outlook for the company, we believe Gilead will outperform the market in the near
term.
Risks
In addition to the well-documented clinical, regulatory, and financial risks associated with owning the shares of a
biotechnology company such as Gilead, we believe the company’s dependence on its HIV franchise represents a fundamental
risk for investors. Gilead’s entrance into new markets, such as the cardiopulmonary space, where it is not a major player, poses
a risk to the company. The HCV space is also very competitive, and even though we believe Gilead is the market leader, the
competitive threat remains.
Our earnings model is shown on the following page.

Company Profile: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth companies. Growth companies by their nature tend to be more
volatile than the overall stock market. Company profile is a fundamental assessment, over a longer-term horizon, of the business risk of the company
relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track
record, market leadership, distinctive capabilities); 2) financial profile (earnings growth rate/consistency, cash flow generation, return on
investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, confidence in long-term
growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E) – Fundamental risk is lower relative to the broader William Blair universe; Core Growth (C) –
Fundamental risk is approximately in line with the broader William Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A) – Fundamental risk is higher relative to
the broader William Blair universe.
The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company profile assessments reflect the opinion of the individual analyst and
are subject to change at any time.
