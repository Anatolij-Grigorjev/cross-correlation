HepC price wars worsen, tail comes more quickly; ABBV PT to $73
HepC pricing discounts greater than expected; but volumes higher
On GILD’s 4Q earnings call, management called out a gross to net pricing
discount of 46% in the US in 2015 for their hepC franchise vs. a gross to net
discount of 22% at the end of 2014. This implies pricing of~$50K per cure
for g1 patients vs. our expectations of ~$70K. We had expected hepC
pricing to decline, but the speed of the discounts is far greater then we had
expected. On the positive side, GILD stated that they believe >250K
patients could be treated per year in the US (prior expectations for 200K),
but that means the peak likely comes more quickly (potentially 2016 versus
2017).

the unique market that is hepC; October 7 2014

More to ABBV than hepC; updating our estimates and price target
We update our global 2016 ABBV hepC estimates to $2.3 bn (from $2.6 bn)
including $1.8 bn for the US market. We maintain our $1.8 bn world wide
forecast for 2015, which is below guidance. Our 2016 estimate assumes
less than 20% market share of g1 patients in the US based on our
assumption of $50K pricing and 250K patients treated per year (around
75% of which are g1 patients). We also update our 12-month price target
to $73 (prior $75). ABBV claims that they weren’t surprised by GILD’s
comments and that their guidance for Viekira assumes “appropriate” gross
to net discounts. However, with greater-than-expected price discounts we
are now more conservative with our hepC estimates.
HepC now out of ABBV’s share price: We calculate ABBV’s $2.3 bn in
HepC sales in 2016 (peak) is worth about $0.85 in EPS (assuming 75%
operating margin). Using a GILD multiple (~10x 2015 EPS) that implies
around $8/share. ABBV shares have already declined $8 since its peak in
early Dec (mostly all based on hepC concerns in our view).
Reiterate Buy: HepC is a small piece to the ABBV story. Even at peak hepC
represents only ~10% of ABBV sales. ABBV’s multiple reflects basically no
growth (12x 2016 vs 16x for pharma) despite 14% EPS CAGR from 20142018 and meaningful pipeline opportunities (eg. ABT-199, Elagolix, etc).

Risk to our MRK estimates; less room for newer competitors
We have MRK sales peaking at $3-4 bn (unrisk adjusted) which looks to be
at risk based on lower pricing for hepC drugs. We believe MRK’s HepC
plan hinges on a long tail and greater opportunity for late entrance.

HepC class likely unique with limited risk for price war contagion: As we called out in
our global hepC note Oct 2014, we view the hepC market as an exception that is likely to be
contained due to a fixed patient pool, acute curative treatments and substitutable drugs.

We update our ABBV 12-month price target to $73 (prior $75) based on 17x our 2015E EPS
(lower multiple on lower long-term hepC sales), weighted at 85%, and an unchanged M&A
value of $78, weighted at 15%.
Risk include Humira, product launches (hepC), pipeline and business development.

Disclosure Appendix
Reg AC
We, Jami Rubin, Ariel Herman, Jay Olson, CFA and Christopher Benassi, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately reflect
our personal views about the subject company or companies and its or their securities. We also certify that no part of our compensation was, is or
will be, directly or indirectly, related to the specific recommendations or views expressed in this report.
Unless otherwise stated, the individuals listed on the cover page of this report are analysts in Goldman Sachs' Global Investment Research division.

Investment Profile
The Goldman Sachs Investment Profile provides investment context for a security by comparing key attributes of that security to its peer group and
market. The four key attributes depicted are: growth, returns, multiple and volatility. Growth, returns and multiple are indexed based on composites
of several methodologies to determine the stocks percentile ranking within the region's coverage universe.
The precise calculation of each metric may vary depending on the fiscal year, industry and region but the standard approach is as follows:
Growth is a composite of next year's estimate over current year's estimate, e.g. EPS, EBITDA, Revenue. Return is a year one prospective aggregate
of various return on capital measures, e.g. CROCI, ROACE, and ROE. Multiple is a composite of one-year forward valuation ratios, e.g. P/E, dividend
yield, EV/FCF, EV/EBITDA, EV/DACF, Price/Book. Volatility is measured as trailing twelve-month volatility adjusted for dividends.

Quantum
Quantum is Goldman Sachs' proprietary database providing access to detailed financial statement histories, forecasts and ratios. It can be used for
in-depth analysis of a single company, or to make comparisons between companies in different sectors and markets.

GS SUSTAIN
GS SUSTAIN is a global investment strategy aimed at long-term, long-only performance with a low turnover of ideas. The GS SUSTAIN focus list
includes leaders our analysis shows to be well positioned to deliver long term outperformance through sustained competitive advantage and
superior returns on capital relative to their global industry peers. Leaders are identified based on quantifiable analysis of three aspects of corporate
performance: cash return on cash invested, industry positioning and management quality (the effectiveness of companies' management of the
environmental, social and governance issues facing their industry).

Ratings, coverage groups and views and related definitions
Buy (B), Neutral (N), Sell (S) -Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy

or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's return potential relative to its coverage group as described below. Any stock not assigned as
a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List is deemed Neutral. Each regional Investment Review Committee manages various regional Investment Lists to a
global guideline of 25%-35% of stocks as Buy and 10%-15% of stocks as Sell; however, the distribution of Buys and Sells in any particular coverage
group may vary as determined by the regional Investment Review Committee. Regional Conviction Buy and Sell lists represent investment
recommendations focused on either the size of the potential return or the likelihood of the realization of the return.
Return potential represents the price differential between the current share price and the price target expected during the time horizon associated
with the price target. Price targets are required for all covered stocks. The return potential, price target and associated time horizon are stated in each
report adding or reiterating an Investment List membership.
Coverage groups and views: A list of all stocks in each coverage group is available by primary analyst, stock and coverage group at

The analysts named in this report may have from time to time discussed with our clients, including Goldman Sachs salespersons and traders, or may
