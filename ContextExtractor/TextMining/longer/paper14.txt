FORECAST INCREASE

The King is dead, long live the King
GILD reported Q4 earnings post-close today with the Street mostly focused on
the HCV market dynamics. The three key take-aways are:
The upside to the HCV market is now capped. As the parameters of the
global HCV market have become increasingly clearer (everything is relative); we
believe the potential upside to market opportunity will become capped (until
proven otherwise) in the eyes of the market (which, by definition, is always right).
Mgmt. commented that they believe the US has the capacity to treat ~200K250K patients each year. Assuming a net price of ~$45K/pt (did you hear about
the gross to net?) we get a US market opportunity of ~$9B-$11B. Similarly, if
~150-200K patients are treated ex-US at a net price of $35K, this results in a
$5B-$7B market opportunity (i.e.$14B-$18B globally). This removes the
possibility of an outcome favored by the megabulls, who argued that HCV could
grow to be a >$20B therapeutic area. We have flagged in our previous note
(Just saying…The HCV Market Who Knows) that we do not believe that HCV
market can grow to be the biggest therapeutic area and the higher than
expected gross to net discounts (46% in '15 vs. 22% in '14) will cap the upside
to the HCV market.(see Exhibit1). We make minor changes to our model and
our new FY'15,'16,'17 EPS estimates go to $8.65, $9.21 and $9.00.
The size of the gross-to-net discount was a surprise on the upside.
Inevitably, the 46% gross to net discount is only going to get larger over time
(basic laws of economics). GILD alluded that the 46% gross to net discount will
result in a larger patient population through greater access. However, it is
important to note that the HCV market has a finite patient population. While, we
feel that further price discounts are certain as new players enter the market, the
2015 size of gross to net discount is still a surprise (see our note "What is the N
Number"). To be perfectly clear, this is not a criticism, GILD's strategy of front
running HCV patients at a lower price is likely the best strategy given the current
scenario.

…continued from the previous page…
Capital allocation/Pipeline. GILD announced a quarterly dividend of $0.43
starting in Q2:'15. This could be viewed as means to offset the limited future
upside revenue opportunity from the HCV franchise. However, we agree with
GILD's comment that their dividend policy is a sign of confidence in future strong
cash flows and robust balance sheet. We fully support such a decision as we
have highlighted importance of agency cost in many of our notes (LINK). What
next? HCV story has limited upside to expectations. In the H2'15, GILD will
become a pipeline story similar to BIIB/CELG, whose ramp of the blockbuster
drugs are factored in.
Earnings Summary: GILD beat on the topline ($7.3B vs. CS/cons $6.6B/$6.7B),
combined Sovaldi/Harvoni revenues ($3.8B) came in slightly above
CS/consensus ($3.5B/$3.8B). The beat on the topline was aided by higher than
expected revenues in the HIV franchise (with mgmt. noting that there was higher
than normal inventory stocking which is expected to return to normal ranges by
the end of Q1) and solid growth in the HCV franchise. Importantly, GILD
announced a 46% gross to net discount as well as provided granularity on HCV
pricing and market dynamics and FY'15 revenue guidance, which was below cons.
estimates by ~$2.0B. Understandably, the majority of the conf call focus was on
HCV dynamics, their capital allocation policy and the higher than expected gross
to net adjustment.
Changes to Guidance and Out-Year Estimates: GILD provided FY'15 guidance.
GILD expects Total Net Product Sales of $26.0-$27.0B, Product GM of 87%-90%,
R&D of $3.0B - $3.3B, SG&A of $3.0 - $3.3B, and tax rate of 18%-20%. Projected
diluted EPS impact related to acquisition, restructuring and compensation is
guided to $0.82 - $0.87.
Valuation: Our unchanged TP of $130 is based on ~14.1x multiple on FY'16 EPS
of $9.21 representing a 5% discount to the 2016 S&P500 PE multiple. We believe
that in order to justify a multiple expansion, we will need to see greater visibility
into GILD's pipeline.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received Compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's
total revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities

As of December 10, 2012 Analysts’ stock rating are defined as follows:
Outperform (O) : The stock’s total return is expected to outperform the relevant benchmark*over the next 12 months.
Neutral (N) : The stock’s total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* over the next 12 months.
Underperform (U) : The stock’s total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* over the next 12 months.
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 10th December 2012, Japanese ratings are based on a stock’s total return relat ive to the analyst's coverage universe which
consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector, with Outperforms representing the most attractiv e, Neutrals the less attractive, and
Underperforms the least attractive investment opportunities. As of 2nd October 2012, U.S. and Canadian as well as European ratings are based on a stock’s total
return relative to the analyst's coverage universe which consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector, with Outperforms representing the
most attractive, Neutrals the less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investment opportunities. For Latin Ame rican and non-Japan Asia stocks, ratings
are based on a stock’s total return relative to the average total return of the relevant country or regional benchmark; prior to 2nd October 2012 U.S. and Canadian
ratings were based on (1) a stock’s absolute total return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative attractiv eness of a stock’s total return potential within
an analyst’s coverage universe. For Australian and New Zealand stocks, 12-month rolling yield is incorporated in the absolute total return calculation and a 15% and
a 7.5% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock rating definitions, respectively. The 15% and 7.5% thresholds replace the +10 15% and -10-15% levels in the Neutral stock rating definition, respectively. Prior to 10th December 2012, Japanese ratings were based on a stock’s total return
relative to the average total return of the relevant country or regional benchmark.

Restricted (R) : In certain circumstances, Credit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications,
including an investment recommendation, during the course of Credit Suisse's engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other
circumstances.
Volatility Indicator [V] : A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24
months or the analyst expects significant volatility going forward.
Analysts’ sector weightings are distinct from analysts’ stock ratings and are based on the analyst’s expectations for the fundamentals and/or
valuation of the sector* relative to the group’s historic fundamentals and/or valuation:
Overweight : The analyst’s expectation for the sector’s fundamentals and/or valuation is favorable over the next 12 months.
Market Weight : The analyst’s expectation for the sector’s fundamentals and/or valuation is neutral over the next 12 months.
Underweight : The analyst’s expectation for the sector’s fundamentals and/or valuation is cautious over the next 12 months.
*An analyst’s coverage sector consists of all companies covered by the analy st within the relevant sector. An analyst may cover multiple sectors.

instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or
income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADR's, the values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. Structured securities are complex
instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and assuming the risks involved. The market value of any
structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and
volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with
their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. Some investments discussed in this report may have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience
sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may
exceed the amount of initial investment and, in such circumstances, you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence,
initial capital paid to make the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed. This report may provide the addresses of, or contain hyperlinks to, websites. Except to the
