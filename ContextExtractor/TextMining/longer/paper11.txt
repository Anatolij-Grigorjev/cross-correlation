Lowering Numbers; Why It's Still a Buy

Biotechnology

Conclusions on 4Q update: Surprises in both directions; net: Lowering ests
Despite a 10% beat on 4Q EPS and the upside surprise of a new $15bn share buyback
and Gilead's first-ever dividend, the focus of Gilead's 4Q was on the downside surprise
of guiding to a 46% gross-to-net adjustment for HCV sales in 2015 (vs. 22% at YE14).
Clearly this negatively affects sales and market size forecasts, both of which we move
lower in our model. We further think the discounting will impact not only GILD shares,
but also represents a headline negative for the sector (though several names are less
exposed to price erosion). That said, it's really not the end of the world for GILD
numbers, since [1] we ultimately got to that level of HCV discounting (just not until the
outer years), and [2] this level of discounting occurs in other large segments as well,
such as HIV and multiple sclerosis. The offset to the lower value of the HCV market is
the value creation from capital allocation. Although we expect a hit to the stock, we
maintain our Buy rating, as our DCF is still supportive; the multiple is already cheaper
than all other biotechs / pharma, and pipeline and M&A could drive multiple expansion.
Impact of wider gross-to-net
[1] Lower HCV market value. The 46% gross-to-net is about twice as wide as we
expected, and lowers our sales and market size estimates (peak global HCV market size:
$24bn, from $28bn). [2] Volumes are going higher… As expected the volumes
compensate for lower pricing near term. Arguably the market penetration will be
higher over time because it will be more affordable to treat patients. [3] …but the
patients are being treated sooner. This is good: more patients are captured by
Gilead ahead of further competition, and the time value of money says sooner is better
than later. However, out year ests go lower as the patient pool is depleted faster.
Impact to our model: Lowering 2015e EPS by 4%, but numbers more concrete
We increased the gross-to-net in HCV to 46% in 2015e, and increasing thereafter. This
lowers our sales and EPS estimates, though the new $15bn repo and dividend helps
offset.

Investment case

Business description

We rate GILD shares BUY, on the basis of 1) several pipeline
catalysts over the next 12 months, 2) potential upside to 201516 estimates, which have been reset lower, and 3) the lowest P/E
multiple on 2016E EPS. Key to upside to 2015 numbers is the
launch of Harvoni in hepatitis C, which should drive share
outperformance as we expect GILD's HCV regimens to be both
the first- and best in a very large market with double-digit-billion
dollar potential. Additionally, we see significant pipeline
opportunities with simtuzumab in fibrosis, and in the TAF
program in HIV that provides opportunities to extend the life of
the franchise beyond the core tenofovir patents expire in 2018.
Further, we view oncology as an underappreciated program.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. discovers, develops, and commercializes
treatments for infectious and pulmonary diseases. Its currently
marketed products include Stribild, Complera, Atripla, Truvada,
Viread, and Emtriva for HIV; Hepsera for hepatitis B; and
AmBisome for the treatment of fungal diseases. Gilead also
receives royalties from Roche for Tamiflu, a treatment for
influenza. Gilead's key pipeline programs are sofosbuvir in
hepatitis C, TAF in HIV, and idelisilib in cancer.

Upside scenario
Our upside scenario of $142 reflects a higher multiple (14x, still
at a discount to the group) to reflect a bullish outlook on the
pipeline and cash flow redeployment, as well as for the HCV and
HIV businesses. In HCV, upside drivers include a higher diagnosis
rate leading to a larger market opportunity and deeper
penetration. Additional upside could come from reimbursement
and pricing, where our base-case model is relatively conservative.
We see additional upside from HIV and TAF, with higher
utilization extending the revenue tail before patent expiry.
Downside scenario
Our downside scenario of $89 reflects a suppressed (8.5x)
multiple to reflect a failure of the pipeline and weak HCV sales
due to pricing pressure or competition.

Industry outlook
As an industry, we expect biotech stocks to outperform the
broader markets on the basis of attractive growth relative to
the S&P 500. Within biotech, the long term revenue and
earnings growth outlook is the key determinant of biotech
stock performance. Companies creating new product cycles
through organic pipeline development and strategic
acquisitions, paired with financial metrics and shareholder
friendly programs (buy-backs, dividends, etc) are likely to
outperform. Gilead's significant double-digit growth is above
the peer group mean and in our view, justifies a higher
multiple than currently implied on 2014-15 EPS. Further, GILD
could see significant multiple expansion relative to peers if
acquisitions or pipeline development improves the out-year
outlook.

Key facts and comments from the quarter
[1] HCV pricing. The 46% is a blended discount for Sovaldi and Harvoni across
payers, reflecting larger private discounts (we est 40%) and a shift in mix toward
public payers who receive discounting over 50%. The discounts are triggered by
volumes, with contracts set to limit denials and increase access (in-line, see HERE).
[2] Patient access. Contracts are in place for about 60% of covered lives in US, and
Harvoni gained access to 80% of those. The treatment rate in EU will be lower due
to budgetary constraints
[3] 4Q numbers. HIV is in great shape, beating by $181m (7%), driven by higher
US sales across major products. Mgmt did not exclude the possibility for a HIV
price increase in 2015. Harvoni beat by $466m (30%), with inventory 2-3days
($65-100m) higher than normal.
[4] Guidance. $26-27bn of 2015 product sales (consensus $28bn) factored in

discount and 250k treatment capacity in HCV.
[5] Pipeline. The BTK inhibitor will be studies in combination with Gilead's other

kinase inhibitors. The 4 and 6wk data of the pan-genotypic triple pill will be
presented at EASL. The MMP9 antibody is advancing based on activity in ph1b.

The tables showing the 4Q variance and changes to our model appear in the
following pages.

Statement of Risk
We see several risks to our BUY rating on GILD shares. If the Quad pill in HIV fails
to achieve revenue expectations we expect shares would react negatively.
Additionally, if generic entrants come to the market sooner than expected, or take
a larger portion of the HIV market share than we currently model. Further, if
pricing pressure in Europe, and discounts and rebates in the US also continue, we
expect GILD shares could react negatively. Most importantly however, we believe
GILD shares are levered to the success/failure of the HCV program. and note risk to
our Buy rating if [1] Sofosbuvir launch fails to meet expectations, [2] competitor
data impress, or [3] regulatory decisions cause potential delays to approval.

Source: UBS. Rating allocations are as of 31 December 2014.
1:Percentage of companies under coverage globally within the 12-month rating category. 2:Percentage of companies within
the 12-month rating category for which investment banking (IB) services were provided within the past 12 months.
3:Percentage of companies under coverage globally within the Short-Term rating category. 4:Percentage of companies
within the Short-Term rating category for which investment banking (IB) services were provided within the past 12 months.
KEY DEFINITIONS: Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend
yield over the next 12 months. Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate
plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR
by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to possible change in the near term, usually
in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term Ratings reflect the expected nearterm (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the fundamental view or investment
case. Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months.
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES: UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive
on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure,
management, performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance
record, discount. Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the
Investment Review Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the
respective company's debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands
as they relate to the rating. When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the
relevant research piece.
Research analysts contributing to this report who are employed by any non-US affiliate of UBS Securities LLC are not

This document has been prepared by UBS Securities LLC, an affiliate of UBS AG. UBS AG, its subsidiaries, branches and affiliates are referred to herein as UBS.
This document is for distribution only as may be permitted by law. It is not directed to, or intended for distribution to or use by, any person or entity who is a citizen or
resident of or located in any locality, state, country or other jurisdiction where such distribution, publication, availability or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
would subject UBS to any registration or licensing requirement within such jurisdiction. It is published solely for information purposes; it is not an advertisement nor is it
a solicitation or an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. No representation or warranty, either express or
implied, is provided in relation to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information contained in this document (‘the Information’), except with respect to
Information concerning UBS. The Information is not intended to be a complete statement or summary of the securities, markets or developments referred to in the
document. UBS does not undertake to update or keep current the Information. Any opinions expressed in this document may change without notice and may differ or
be contrary to opinions expressed by other business areas or groups of UBS. Any statements contained in this report attributed to a third party represent UBS's
interpretation of the data, information and/or opinions provided by that third party either publicly or through a subscription service, and such use and interpretation
have not been reviewed by the third party.
Nothing in this document constitutes a representation that any investment strategy or recommendation is suitable or appropriate to an investor’s individual
circumstances or otherwise constitutes a personal recommendation. Investments involve risks, and investors should exercise prudence and their own judgement in
making their investment decisions. The financial instruments described in the document may not be eligible for sale in all jurisdictions or to certain categories of
investors. Options, derivative products and futures are not suitable for all investors, and trading in these instruments is considered risky. Mortgage and asset-backed
securities may involve a high degree of risk and may be highly volatile in response to fluctuations in interest rates or other market conditions. Foreign currency rates of
exchange may adversely affect the value, price or income of any security or related instrument referred to in the document. For investment advice, trade execution or
other enquiries, clients should contact their local sales representative.
The value of any investment or income may go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full (or any) amount invested. Past performance is not necessarily
a guide to future performance. Neither UBS nor any of its directors, employees or agents accepts any liability for any loss (including investment loss) or damage arising
out of the use of all or any of the Information.
Any prices stated in this document are for information purposes only and do not represent valuations for individual securities or other financial instruments. There is no
representation that any transaction can or could have been effected at those prices, and any prices do not necessarily reflect UBS's internal books and records or
theoretical model-based valuations and may be based on certain assumptions. Different assumptions by UBS or any other source may yield substantially different results.
This document and the Information are produced by UBS as part of its research function and are provided to you solely for general background information. UBS has no
regard to the specific investment objectives, financial situation or particular needs of any specific recipient. In no circumstances may this document or any of the
Information be used for any of the following purposes:
(i) valuation or accounting purposes;
(ii) to determine the amounts due or payable, the price or the value of any financial instrument or financial contract; or
(iii) to measure the performance of any financial instrument.
By receiving this document and the Information you will be deemed to represent and warrant to UBS that you will not use this document or any of the Information for
any of the above purposes or otherwise rely upon this document or any of the Information.
Research will initiate, update and cease coverage solely at the discretion of UBS Investment Bank Research Management. The analysis contained in this document is
based on numerous assumptions. Different assumptions could result in materially different results. The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this document may
interact with trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other parties for the purpose of gathering, applying and interpreting market information. UBS relies on
information barriers to control the flow of information contained in one or more areas within UBS into other areas, units, groups or affiliates of UBS. The compensation
of the analyst who prepared this document is determined exclusively by research management and senior management (not including investment banking). Analyst
compensation is not based on investment banking revenues; however, compensation may relate to the revenues of UBS Investment Bank as a whole, of which
investment banking, sales and trading are a part.
For financial instruments admitted to trading on an EU regulated market: UBS AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries (excluding UBS Securities LLC) acts as a market maker or
liquidity provider (in accordance with the interpretation of these terms in the UK) in the financial instruments of the issuer save that where the activity of liquidity
provider is carried out in accordance with the definition given to it by the laws and regulations of any other EU jurisdictions, such information is separately disclosed in
this document. For financial instruments admitted to trading on a non-EU regulated market: UBS may act as a market maker save that where this activity is carried out in
the US in accordance with the definition given to it by the relevant laws and regulations, such activity will be specifically disclosed in this document. UBS may have issued
a warrant the value of which is based on one or more of the financial instruments referred to in the document. UBS and its affiliates and employees may have long or
short positions, trade as principal and buy and sell in instruments or derivatives identified herein; such transactions or positions may be inconsistent with the opinions
expressed in this document.
