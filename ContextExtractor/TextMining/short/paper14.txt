 The King is dead, long live the King
GILD reported Q4 earnings post-close today with the Street mostly focused on the HCV market dynamics. The three key take-aways are:
The upside to the HCV market is now capped. As the parameters of the global HCV market have become increasingly clearer (everything is relative); we believe the potential upside to market opportunity will become capped (until proven otherwise) in the eyes of the market (which, by definition, is always right). Mgmt. commented that they believe the US has the capacity to treat ~200K- 250K patients each year. Assuming a net price of ~$45K/pt (did you hear about the gross to net?) we get a US market opportunity of ~$9B-$11B. Similarly, if ~150-200K patients are treated ex-US at a net price of $35K, this results in a $5B-$7B market opportunity (i.e.$14B-$18B globally). This removes the possibility of an outcome favored by the megabulls, who argued that HCV could grow to be a >$20B therapeutic area. We have flagged in our previous note (Just saying…The HCV Market Who Knows) that we do not believe that HCV market can grow to be the biggest therapeutic area and the higher than expected gross to net discounts (46% in '15 vs. 22% in '14) will cap the upside to the HCV market.(see Exhibit1). We make minor changes to our model and our new FY'15,'16,'17 EPS estimates go to $8.65, $9.21 and $9.00.
The size of the gross-to-net discount was a surprise on the upside. Inevitably, the 46% gross to net discount is only going to get larger over time (basic laws of economics). GILD alluded that the 46% gross to net discount will result in a larger patient population through greater access. However, it is important to note that the HCV market has a finite patient population. While, we feel that further price discounts are certain as new players enter the market, the 2015 size of gross to net discount is still a surprise (see our note "What is the N Number"). To be perfectly clear, this is not a criticism, GILD's strategy of front running HCV patients at a lower price is likely the best strategy given the current scenario.

Capital allocation/Pipeline. GILD announced a quarterly dividend of $0.43 starting in Q2:'15. This could be viewed as means to offset the limited future upside revenue opportunity from the HCV franchise. However, we agree with GILD's comment that their dividend policy is a sign of confidence in future strong cash flows and robust balance sheet. We fully support such a decision as we have highlighted importance of agency cost in many of our notes (LINK). What next? HCV story has limited upside to expectations. In the H2'15, GILD will become a pipeline story similar to BIIB/CELG, whose ramp of the blockbuster drugs are factored in.
Earnings Summary: GILD beat on the topline ($7.3B vs. CS/cons $6.6B/$6.7B), combined Sovaldi/Harvoni revenues ($3.8B) came in slightly above CS/consensus ($3.5B/$3.8B). The beat on the topline was aided by higher than expected revenues in the HIV franchise (with mgmt. noting that there was higher than normal inventory stocking which is expected to return to normal ranges by the end of Q1) and solid growth in the HCV franchise. Importantly, GILD announced a 46% gross to net discount as well as provided granularity on HCV pricing and market dynamics and FY'15 revenue guidance, which was below cons. estimates by ~$2.0B. Understandably, the majority of the conf call focus was on HCV dynamics, their capital allocation policy and the higher than expected gross to net adjustment.
Changes to Guidance and Out-Year Estimates: GILD provided FY'15 guidance. GILD expects Total Net Product Sales of $26.0-$27.0B, Product GM of 87%-90%, R&D of $3.0B - $3.3B, SG&A of $3.0 - $3.3B, and tax rate of 18%-20%. Projected diluted EPS impact related to acquisition, restructuring and compensation is guided to $0.82 - $0.87.
Valuation: Our unchanged TP of $130 is based on ~14.1x multiple on FY'16 EPS of $9.21 representing a 5% discount to the 2016 S&P500 PE multiple. We believe that in order to justify a multiple expansion, we will need to see greater visibility into GILD's pipeline.
