hepC pricing pressure steeper than expected; cutting estimates
What's changed
GILD reported 4Q14 revenue of $7.3 bn ahead of GS/consensus of
$6.8 bn/$6.7 bn and 4Q14 EPS of $2.43 vs. GS/consensus of $2.35/$2.21.
Total hepC sales in 4Q14 were $3.8 bn ($1.7 bn Sovaldi and $2.1 bn
Harvoni) ahead of GS/consensus of $3.7 bn/$3.5 bn. GILD provided 2015
sales guidance of $26-27 bn vs. GS new/GS prior/consensus of
$26.3 bn/$28.1 bn/ $27.9 bn, R&D was $3.0-3.3 bn (GS new/prior of
$3.2 bn/$2.88 bn), SG&A was $3.0-3.3 bn (GS new/prior/consensus
$3.2 bn/$2.86 bn), gross margin was 87%-90% and tax rate was 18%-20%.
We are updating our EPS estimates to reflect 4Q trends and guidance.
Implications
HepC pricing dynamics surprise to the downside. GILD guided to a 46%
gross-to-net on US hepC pricing in 2015 (vs. 22% in 2014) given recent
PBM contracts and a mix shift to more government vs. private. While
increased volumes are likely to offset some of this, we lower our 2015+
estimates by $2bn. GILD became the second biotech company to issue
a dividend, beginning in 2Q15 ($1.72/share on an annual basis), which
equates to a 1.6% yield. While we believe this could be well received by
many investors (some had viewed it as a proxy for sustainability of hepC),
we note that when weighed against the pricing dynamics we do not
believe it is enough to change the debate on the tail. Finally, GILD
reported that there was no signal for Simtuzumab in two additional
Ph2 indications (myelofibrosis and colon cancer). While there are ongoing
Ph2 trials (NASH and IPF) expectations are likely to remain low.
