The Cowen Insight
GILD reported Q4:14 HCV sales ahead of consensus, and provided 2015 product sales
guidance generally in line with expectations. Management's gross to net commentary
implies larger discounts in 2015 than anticipated, which we expect will stoke investors'
fears about price competition and the longevity of the U.S. patient bolus. We continue
to believe GILD is undervalued and maintain our $125 PT.
Strong Q4 HCV Sales Drive Top- And Bottom- Line Upside.
Q4 HCV sales were $3.8B, ahead of our $3.75BE and consensus of about $3.35B. U.S.
sales were $3.2B, and ex-US were $660MM. Management indicated that wholesaler
inventories were at the upper end of the contractual range, suggesting stocking
contributed some of the upside. Q4 HIV franchise revenue was $2.9B (+15.5%Y/Y),
ahead of our $2.7BE and consensus of $2.6B. Total revenue was $7.3B (+135% Y/Y) vs
our $7.0BE and consensus of $6.7B. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.43 vs our $2.41E.
2015 Product Sales And GM Guidance Consistent With Expectations, But
Gross To Net Commentary Worse.
GILD guided to 2015 product sales of $26B-$27B, and non-GAAP gross margins
of 87%-90%. With expectations for 2015 non-HCV product sales at about $13B,
guidance therefore implies 2015 HCV worldwide sales of $13B - $14B, which we think
is generally in line with prior expectations. Prior GM consensus was 87.6%. Notably,
Gilead expects the U.S. gross to net adjustment on HCV sales to increase from 22%
in 2014 to 46% in 2015. Management indicated that the increase is due to public
payors (Medicaid, VA, etc) making up a larger percentage of the mix in 2015, as well
as larger discounts being negotiated with private payors. Gilead said that private
payors' discounts are correlated to market access, meaning that payors with fewer
restrictions in their formulary will be granted a larger discount. In fact, with improving
market access, GILD projects there could be as many as 250K HCV patients treated
in the U.S. in 2015. Unfortunately, GILD investors have two major concerns: HCV price
competition, and the longevity of the HCV patient bolus. We expect this commentary
to stoke both fears as investors will worry that discounts will continue to increase as
more players enter the HCV market, and that the diagnosed U.S. patient population
will be treated more quickly.
Tweaking Our 2015 HCV Estimate.
While the net price in the U.S. market is less than we anticipated, ex-US volumes
are increasing more quickly, and these effects largely offset. We have cut our 2015
U.S. GT 1 price from $60K to $48K, and our GT2/3 price from $84K to $52K. We have
modestly increased our share assumptions, but our 2015 U.S. estimate has decreased
from $12.8B to $10B. Our ex-U.S. pricing assumptions have remained the same (~
$40K-50K), but now we project GILD will treat 93K patients ex-U.S., while we had
projected 46K. Our ex-U.S. HCV est has increased from $2.2B to $4.5B. Our 2015 HCV
est has decreased from $15B to $14.5B, although our 2016-2019 ests are unchanged.

At A Glance
Our Investment Thesis
We believe Sovaldi will be the cornerstone of future all-oral HCV combos. Sovaldi
was launched in the U.S. in December 2013, and we project Gilead’s HCV franchise
will achieve $18B in worldwide sales by 2019. We expect that through a combination
of HIV market growth, share gains, and price increases, GILD's HIV franchise will
continue to grow at least in line with our projections for a 2% CAGR during 2014-19E.
We expect GILD to outperform the market over the next 12 months as Gilead's HIV
franchise continues to grow, the HCV franchise's launch progresses, and consensus
estimates continue to increase.
Forthcoming Catalysts
■ EASL presentations (April 22-26)
■ Data from simtuzumab in NASH
(H2:15)
■ TAF U.S. and EU regulatory decisions
(Q4)
Base Case Assumptions
■ HCV sales reach $14.5B in 2015 and
$18B in 2019
■ GILD's HIV franchise grows from
$10B in 2014 to $12.6B in 2017, and
declines following the expiration of
tenofovir's patents.
■ The rest of GILD's pipeline and
product portfolio contributes modest
value
Upside Scenario
■ GILD's HCV franchise significantly
exceeds $20B in peak sales potential
■ TAF successfully extends the HIV
franchise's dominance beyond
tenofivir patent expiration
■ A candidate from GILD's pipeline
generates significant revenue
Downside Scenario
■ Payers/competition constrain Sovaldi
adoption and/or sales fail to achieve
our forecasts
■ GILD's HIV franchise fails to meet
our projections due to competition,
or a major change in the treatment
paradigm
