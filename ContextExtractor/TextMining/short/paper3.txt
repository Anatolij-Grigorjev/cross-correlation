Highlights
ä We estimate 2015 sales increasing 10.9% to
$27.6 billion, driven by GILD's hepatitis C (HCV)
franchise of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni, a
fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.
Our forecast is slightly above GILD's
guidance of $26.0 billion to $27.0 billion, that we
see as conservative, in spite of competition and
larger discounts in 2015. GILD estimates a 46%
gross-to-net adjustment for its HCV franchise,
compared to 22% at the end of 2014. In 2014,
170K patients were treated with GILD's HCV
drugs and it estimates up to 250K patients treated
in 2015, driven by expanded patient access
in the U.S and in Europe as more reimbursement
agreements have been reached. Although
we think the AbbVie and Express Scripts deal
with AbbVie's Viekira Pak as the exclusive
genotype 1 HCV drug on Express Script's formulary
raises some uncertainty on sales, we
see GILD maintaining a dominant market share.
We also continue to view favorably GILD's
leading U.S. HIV drug market share.
ä We see gross margin of 90% and operating
margins of 68.3% in 2015, up from 66.6% in 2014.
ä We see EPS of $9.56 in 2015.
Investment Rationale/Risk
ä In spite of recent share volatility due to competition
from AbbVie's recently approved HCV
drug, Viekira, and exclusive deal with Express
Scripts, we expect GILD's HCV program to
maintain a dominant market position.We believe
AbbVie will likely obtain a 20% market
share in HCV, but we believe Harvoni is the
physician's preferred choice due to significantly
easier compliance as Viekira requires 4-6
pills with dosing more than once a day.We also
believe Harvoni's clinical data is superior with
the FDA labeling requiring Viekira to be taken
with ribavirin for genotype 1 treatment-naive,
non-cirrhotic patients.We also believe many
patients will be eligible for an eight-week treatment
regimen of Harvoni, which would eliminate
Viekira's price advantage. With GILD's
shares trading at 11.1X our 2015 EPS estimate,
well below peers and historical levels, we believe
the shares are attractively valued.
ä Risks to our recommendation and target price
include a significant slowdown in Sovaldi sales.
ä Our 12-month target price of $143 is 15.0X our
2015 EPS estimate, and reflecting a 0.75X PEG
multiple, well below peers.
 
 
CORPORATE OVERVIEW. Gilead Sciences (GILD) focuses on the research, development, and marketing of
anti-infective medications, with a primary focus on treatments for HIV.
GILD has a leading market position in treating HIV virus. Truvada, approved in 2004, is a once-daily combination
tablet formulated with previous-generation drugs Viread and Emtriva. Viread was approved in 2001.
Truvada generated 2013 sales of $3.136 billion, slightly below 2012 sales of $3.18 billion. Viread is also used
for treating hepatitis B, and saw 13% sales growth to $959 million in 2013 from $849 million in 2012. In 2006,
GILD and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) launched Atripla, a combination tablet with Truvada and BMY's
Sustiva. Atripla generated 2013 sales of $3.65 billion up 2% from 2012 sales of $3.58 billion. Atripla received
EU approval in December 2007.
More recently, Complera (U.S.) and Eviplera (Europe), comprised of Truvada and Tibotec's Edurant
(rilpivirine), were approved in 2011, and generated $809 million in 2013 sales, up significantly from $342 million
in 2012 sales. In August 2012, the FDA approved GILD's wholly owned "Quad Pill," marketed as Stribild,
which combines investigational agents elvitegravir, and HIV-boosting agent cobicistat, with Truvada in patients
new to HIV treatment. In Phase III study, Stribild showed non-inferiority to Atripla, with a favorable
side effect profile. In May 2013, Stribild was approved in the European Union. Stribild saw sales of $539
million in 2013 compared to initial sales of $58 million in 2012.
Hepsera, approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the U.S. and EU, saw sales decline to $81 million
in 2013 following the 25% decline in 2012, to $108 million. AmBisome B, an antifungal agent that is approved
for life-threatening fungal infections including cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients, generated sales
of $352 million in 2013, up slightly from the $348 million in 2012. Tamiflu, an orally administered treatment for
influenza A and B, is marketed by Roche, which pays GILD a 21%-22% royalty. Tamiflu's patents expire at
the end of 2016.
In October 2006, GILD purchased Myogen for $2.5 billion for rights to Letairis, a once-daily treatment for
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which was approved in June 2007. In 2013, Letairis generated $520
million in sales, up 27% from the $410 million in sales in 2012. In 2009, GILD purchased CV Therapeutics for
its lead drug Ranexa for chronic angina. Ranexa generated 2013 sales of $449 million, up 20% from the $373
million in sales in 2012. Cayston (aztreonam lysine), an inhaled medicine for cystic fibrosis, was approved
by the FDA in February 2010 and is conditionally approved in Europe, with final approval conditional upon
completion of an ongoing study.
PIPELINE. GILD is advancing a pipeline for hepatitis C, centered around Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), acquired from
Pharmasset. The drug secured FDA approval in December 2013 for genotypes 1 and 4 (12 weeks, with interferon/
ribavirin), genotype 2 (12 weeks, with ribavirin), genotype 3 (24 weeks, with ribavirin). In addition,
the FDA allowed Sovaldi/ribavirin to be considered in patients intolerant to interferon in a 24-week regimen.
In October 2014, GILD received FDA approval for Harvoni (Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir), the first once-daily
single tablet regimen for the treatment of Hepatitis C for genotype 1, which accounts for about 75% of U.S
patients, without the use of interferon and ribavirin. Harvoni achieved cure rates (SVR12) of 94%-99% in
three Phase III clinical trials.
In HIV, GILD is in Phase III study on tenofovir alafenamide (GS-7340), which has a more potent profile than
current therapy backbone tenofovir (Viread) in smaller doses, thereby reducing toxicity. In October 2012,
GS-7340 met its primary endpoint of similar virologic response versus GILD's Stribild, with favorable bone
mineral density and serum creatinine outcomes. In April 2011, GILD acquired privately held Calistoga Pharmaceuticals
for $375 million to add pipeline candidates in oncology and inflammation. Lead candidate Zydelig
(idelalisib) was approved by the FDA in late July 2014 for for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and
indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). European accelerated approval for iNHL, and for CLL is pending.
In January 2011, GILD acquired privately held Arresto Biosciences for $225 million for early-stage treatment
for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and advanced solid tumors. In February 2013, GILD acquired YM
Biosciences, a developer of drugs for cancer and inflammatory disorders in a $510 million deal. YM's lead
candidate CYT387 has completed Phase I/II study for blood disorder myelofibrosis.
FINANCIAL TRENDS. In 2013, total revenues rose 15.5% to $11.2 billion, from $9.7 billion in 2012. At September
30, 2014, GILD had $7.7 billion of cash and securities and $9.5 billion of long-term debt. The company issued
$6 billion of new debt to acquire Pharmasset in January 2012. Since January 2010, GILD has repurchased
roughly 169.9 million of its shares for $6.65 billion (including 5.743 million shares repurchased in Q1
2014 for $450 million). GILD commenced a new $5 billion program in 2011, but deferred its program to reduce
debt following the Pharmasset acquisition. In July 2013, GILD resumed its repurchase program and in
July 2014, it announced a new $5 billion program.
 
 
Our positive fundamental outlook for the
biotechnology sub-industry for the next 12 months
reflects favorable prospects for new and novel
therapies to reach commercialization.We are
encouraged by what we view as a strong period for
the reporting of late-stage clinical results, and a
more accommodating U.S. FDA for approvals.
Although the FDA approved 27 new therapies in
2013, down from 39 in 2012, we think many of these
newly approved drugs have significant commercial
prospects and represent major advances in
therapeutic areas such as hepatitis C, multiple
sclerosis and cancer.We expect wider adoption of
biomarker research and genetic-targeted clinical
studies to help bolster long-term R&D pipeline
productivity. In late 2012, the FDA introduced
"breakthrough therapy" designations, intended to
speed development of promising programs, and
granted this designation 35 times, and has approved
three drugs with this status as of May 2014.
We expect a favorable M&A (mergers and
acquisitions) climate, as large pharmaceutical firms
move to offset lost revenues from expiring drug
patents and large biotechs bolster their drug
pipelines amid maturing products.We note an
uptick in M&A speculation and announced deals
recently after a subdued first half of 2013.We also
see large cap biotechs generating cash flows
supporting larger scale acquisitions of their own. In
2011, industry bellwether Amgen became the first
biotech company to initiate a regular dividend.
The 2010 health care reform law established the
FDA's authorization to govern "biosimilar" drug
approvals and set a 12-year exclusivity to branded
drugmakers. However, we see biosimilars
advancing at a slower rate than initially anticipated.
Several firms have abandoned biosimilar plans due
to high development costs and a lack of regulatory
clarity. Once marketed, we expect biosimilars to sell
at more modest price discounts than in the
pharmaceutical industry due to higher clinical,
manufacturing and marketing costs, and we expect
branded drugs to retain significant market share due
to a lack of interchangeability among these options.
We recommend that investors concentrate core
holdings in established, profitable companies, as
smaller biotechs tend to be more volatile.We would
seek companies with at least two years of operating
capital and multiple pipeline value drivers, as those
with smaller pipelines typically suffer significant
share price declines on an unfavorable outcome.
Year-to-date through September 19, the S&P
Biotech Index rose 26.0% vs. a 8.2% gain for the
S&P 1500 Composite Index. In 2013, the S&P Biotech
Index rose 74.2%, vs. a 30.1% gain for the S&P 1500
Index.
