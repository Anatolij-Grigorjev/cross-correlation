 Biotech Newsflow to Pressure ABBV; Overall Risk-Reward Still Positive
■ Bottom Line: Separate disclosures from GILD on pricing for HCV and AMGN on phase 3 Humira biosimilar data likely to pressure ABBV shares in the near-term. While we continue to see positive risk-reward on ABBV in the medium-term, we acknowledge that shares could be pressured/range bound in the near-term. We see sentiment on the HCV front for ABBV recovering only with successful execution and quarterly sales disclosures. Also, while AMGN's Humira biosimilar has now demonstrated equivalence with ABBV in a second indication, we continue to see legal hurdles that are likely to keep a Humira biosimilar out of the market until at least the 2018/2019 timeframe. We reiterate our Outperform on ABBV at these levels on inexpensive valuation, strong near- to mid-term growth profile and optionality from pipeline/M&A.
■ GILD disclosure on hepatitis C pricing suggests modest potential downside to our ABBV HCV regimen price, although market size/share assumptions could offset this. GILD management shared that they expected a 46% gross-to-net adjustment on their HCV regimen in 2015, suggesting modest downside (~5-10%) to our ABBV HCV price assumptions. That said, we continue to be comfortable with our ~$2.1Bn 2015 estimates for ABBV, particularly as we see potential upside from a market expansion and share perspective, and given ABBV guidance on this front on their recent earnings call. ABBV did confirm to us that the guidance they provided is based on pricing dynamics similar to what GILD discussed on their call today.
