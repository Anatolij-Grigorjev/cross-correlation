 Broader Market Opportunity Offsets Discounts in HCV
 
Event
GILD reported 4Q14 results yesterday. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.43 vs. $2.22 consensus, on revenues of $7.31B vs. $6.72B consensus. With a focus on theHCV franchise, GILD reported HARVONI sales of $2.11B ($2.00B in the U.S.)and SOVALDI sales of $1.73B ($1.18B in the U.S.). GILD expects the gross-to-net adjustment for HCV products in the U.S. to be 46% in 2015, compared with22% at year-end 2014. GILD emphasized that the lower gross-to-net ratio is directly tied to opening up access, with some agreements allowing access for patients with fibrosis scores as low as F0, and as such GILD expects asubstantially higher number of patients to be treated in 2015 than in 2014. GILD noted that the U.S. health care system has capacity to treat at least 250,000 HCVpatients in 2015. GILD also reported that approximately 48% of covered lives inthe U.S. now have access to HARVONI. Total HIV product sales were $2.87B vs. $2.63B consensus, up 6% sequentially or 15% YoY. GILD guided to full-year 2015 product sales of $26-27B. GILD also announced quarterly dividendsof $0.43 per share starting in 2Q15, and a new $15B stock buyback program.
 
Impact & Analysis
We are reiterating our Outperform rating on GILD shares following review of 4Q14 results. While gross-to-net adjustments are higher than expected, webelieve broader access and increased patient volume will more than offset this. We continue to expect a significant inflection in growth from HARVONI andbelieve that global launches and line-extension products will establish a more sustainable pattern of sales than currently reflected in GILDâ€™s depressedearnings multiple. Opportunity to sustain growth through strategic investment ofHCV cash flows has also been underestimated in our view, and we see NASH and HBV as two potential pillars of growth beyond HCV
