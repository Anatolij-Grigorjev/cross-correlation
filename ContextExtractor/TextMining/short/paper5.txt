Gilead’s strong 4Q results, newly announced dividend (1.6% yield) and $15B share
buyback were major positives from the call, but most investors will likely focus on
hep C discounting (~46% gross/net adjustment). Clearly, the level of discounting
(which has been a Street obsession) was a negative surprise but looking forward, 1)
pricing is now stable with lower headline risk and 2) patient volumes are poised for a
material acceleration from enhanced patient access. 2015 guidance looked
conservative; we’re still above it with $28.9B in product sales (vs guidance of $26-27B)
with highly achievable patient numbers (196K US; 102K EU; 6K Japan). In sum, we’re
not concerned about AbbVie competitively, we don’t think that pricing will see another
leg down with Merck’s launch in 2016e and we think the bar set by guidance gives a lot
of room for P&L upside moving through 2015. Beyond hep C (yes, there are other
franchises at Gilead), HIV demand trends look good going into 2015 and the pipeline is
progressing in NASH, hep B, RSV, oncology, etc. So we’re buyers on weakness today;
we get it that hep C discounting may drive forecasts marginally lower but ultimately
volumes can more than make up that difference in 2015 and beyond.
• Guidance: Gilead guided to 2015 product sales to $26-27B (Barclays: $28.9B),
which implies hep C sales of ~$13-14B (Barclays: $15.6B). We forecast US/OUS hep
C sales of $10.0B/$5.7B with a higher discount assumption which is likely to be
lower in 1H15 (more commercial) but move higher in 2H (more public pay). OpEx
guidance (R&D: $3-3.3B; SG&A: $3-3.3B) was marginally above estimates.
• Adjusting estimates: We’ve lowered our 2015-2017 hep C forecasts to $15.6B,
$17.5B and $18.2B from $16.9B, $19.9B and $21.6B, but we’re above 2015
guidance and consensus. We have fine-tuned operating expense, which together
with lower revenue forecasts has lowered 2015-2017 non-GAAP EPS estimates to
$10.00, $11.50 and $12.25 from $10.65, $12.35 and $13.30 previously. In year 1,
Gilead’s hep C revenue ($12.4B) and cash flow ($12.8B) eclipsed the price of the
Pharmasset acquisition ($11B); in our view the robust cash flow affords many
options for value creation beyond the dividend and accelerated buyback.
 
 
Takeaways From the Quarter
• Hep C Reimbursement / Access. The key datapoint investors will focus on is the
company’s estimated 2015 Harvoni/Sovaldi gross-to-net adjustment (46% vs. 22% in
2014). Of note, this is a blended average reflecting a private/public mix 75/25 in 2014.
Gilead emphasized that the increased rebates are designed to relax treatment
restrictions and drive patient access. Based on this, we are lowering our U.S. price
assumption to reflect a 28% discount for Sovaldi and a 40% for Harvoni in 2015.
Capacity – Gilead believes the US hep C market comprises 3-4M patients, of which 1.6M
have been diagnosed, and that >250K could be treated in 2015. Our model assumes that
~220K treated US patients in 2015, with ~77% treated by Gilead products. Payor
negotiations – Noted that hep C negotiations have now concluded with payors
addressing ~60% of covered lives in the U.S. (with 80% access to Harvoni). This is
roughly in-line with our own estimates (~70% covered with 80% access for Harvoni; see
our note from last week in conjunction with Barclays PBM analyst Eric Percher).
• Hep C Commercial Performance. Harvoni sales beat consensus by ~$600M offset
somewhat by a Sovaldi miss of ~$270M. U.S. Harvoni sales were particularly strong at
~$2B (given that WW consensus estimates were ~$1.5B. U.S. Sovaldi sales were $1.2B
for the quarter. Gilead noted that Sovaldi still found use in ~30% of GT1 patients in the
4Q; the company expects use in GT1 patients to decrease dramatically as Harvoni
launch continues. Overall, ~140K US patients have now been treated with sofosbuvirbased
regimens since the Sovaldi launch in late 2013.
• EU Hep C Takeaways. We were encouraged by commentary on the sustainability of hep
C patient volumes in Europe, with Gilead noting the EU market will likely have a longertail
than the U.S. Specifically, the company characterized hep C revenues as sustainable
for 10-15 years in Europe, perhaps longer in countries such as Italy. Pricing/Access –
Concluded price/volume negotiations in France, Italy, and Spain, while patients in
Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Germany now have access to Harvoni. EU Volume –
Across Europe 32K (26K in EU Big 5, 4K with Harvoni) have started treatment with a
sofosbuvir-based regimen; hep C EU patient volumes could exceed 100K in 2015.
• HIV Takeaways. 4Q HIV sales were strong (+6% q/q, +15% y/y), beating consensus
estimates by ~$240M, driven by Truvada, Atripla, and Stribild outperformance. Gilead
noted switches from Atripla continue, as Stribild and Complera continue to gain share.
We anticipate modest HIV franchise growth, with 2015 WW sales of $11.1B (+8% y/y)
• Pipeline. Simtuzumab – Failed to show clinical activity in myelofibrosis, pancreatic
cancer, and colorectal cancer. Company cautioned from reading into ongoing studies in
NASH and pulmonary fibrosis, given biologic differences in liver and pulmonary fibrosis
relative to the previously evaluated settings. GS-5745 – Advancing the MMP-9 mAb into
clinical development for ulcerative colitis / gastric cancer in 2015.
• 2015 Guidance. Net Product Sales - $26-27B (Barclays: $2.89B). Assuming non-Hep C
product sales of ~$12.8B implies Hep C sales for the company of ~$13.2-14.2B
(Barclays: $15.6B). Gross-margins: 87-90% (Barclays: 89%). R&D Expense - $3.0-3.3B
(Barclays: $3.2B). SG&A Expense - $3.0-3.3B (Barclays: $3.1BB). Tax Rate: 18-20%
(Barclays: 18%).
• Capital allocation strategy. Dividend – Announced plans to start a quarterly dividend of
$0.43 (~1.6% yield) in 2Q, and to grow the dividend over time (though share
repurchases remain the company’s preferred mechanism). Share repurchases –
Disclosed plans to initiate a 5-year $15B share repurchase plan, on top of an existing
$5B plan of which $3B is remaining.

Changes to Our Model
We’ve lowered our 2015-2017 hep C forecasts to $15.6B, $17.5B and $18.2B from $16.9B,
$19.9B and $21.6B, but we’re above 2015 guidance and consensus. We have fine-tuned
operating expense, which together with lower revenue forecasts has lowered 2015-2017
non-GAAP EPS estimates to $10.00, $11.50 and $12.25 from $10.65, $12.35 and $13.30
previously. In year 1, Gilead’s hep C revenue ($12.4B) and cash flow ($12.8B) eclipsed the
price of the Pharmasset acquisition ($11B); in our view the robust cash flow affords many
options for value creation beyond the dividend and accelerated buyback.
