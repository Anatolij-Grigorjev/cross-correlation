Strong Fourth-Quarter Operating Results; Expect an Active Pipeline
Year in 2015
After the markets closed on Tuesday, February 3, Gilead reported fourth-quarter
operating results that were highlighted by strong overall performance of key products.
Notably, sales of HCV drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni were $3.8 billion, just ahead of our
expectations of $3.5 billion. Exhibit 1 provides a variance analysis of the company’s
operating results compared with our estimates. Management also provided 2015
financial guidance, which takes into account the anticipated effects of shortened therapy
duration and price discounts with the HCV franchise. We illustrate 2015 guidance in
exhibit 2 along with our modified financial estimates.
Key Conclusions Following Management’s Call With Investors Include:
• Overall key product performance was very strong in the quarter. As indicated in
our variance analysis, we are encouraged by the overall performance of key products.
In particular, the HIV franchise continues to provide a consistent revenue stream. We
expect positive operating momentum to continue into 2015 and note from our
experience that management historically gives conservative guidance on its year-end
call.
• 2015 stands to be an active pipeline year highlighted by Phase III readouts with
sofosbuvir in combination with GS-5816 in HCV genotypes 1-6. We expect 2015
to be a highly visible year for Gilead’s HCV franchise, and we anticipate top-line data
from four Phase III trials, which assess the combination of sofosbuvir plus GS-5816, a
pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor (formulated in a single-tablet regimen), for the
treatment of all HCV genotypes. We believe that the company’s pan-genotypic
regimen could have the potential to address a broader patient population compared
with Harvoni, eliminating the need to screen patients for the specific genotype.
Consistent with past years, we believe Gilead will be extremely active at the two
primary HCV conferences, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)
in April and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
meeting in November, and we anticipate further clinical updates from the pipeline at
these venues. Accordingly, exhibit 3 outlines the GS-5816 Phase III program, while
exhibit 4 provides our expectation for upcoming clinical and regulatory catalysts.
In parallel, Gilead continues to push initiatives that have the potential to further
shorten treatment duration. Phase II studies with sofosbuvir in combination with GS-
5816 and GS-9857, which is a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor, are being explored as
4- to 6-week treatment regimens targeting patients who are treatmentnaïve/
treatment-experienced as well as with or without cirrhosis. We expect the
Phase II top-line results will likely read out at EASL in April.

Gilead is a research-based biotechnology company focused on developing therapies for the treatment
of life-threatening diseases. Gilead has been a leader in HIV/AIDS therapeutics and more recently in
HCV, but also has a large product portfolio that includes therapeutics for liver, cardiovascular,
metabolic, and respiratory diseases.
 
Capital allocation and balance sheet considerations: Gilead announces a $0.43 quarterly dividend and a five-year,
$15 billion share-buyback program. Gilead generated operating cash flow of $12.8 billion during 2014, and we highlight
the $2.0 billion share repurchase during the fourth quarter. We have received a considerable number of questions over
the past year regarding Gilead’s strategy for capital redeployment. While we continue to expect the company to pursue
strategic acquisitions and licensing transactions, robust cash flows and a growing balance sheet enabled the company to
offer shareholders a $1.72 annual cash dividend program beginning in the second quarter of this year. In addition, we
expect management to continue to repurchase shares as evidenced by the $15 billion share repurchase authorization that
will commence upon the completion of the existing May 2014 program ($3 billion remaining). Cash and marketable
securities at the end of the quarter were $11.7 billion.
• Our thoughts on the stock remain unchanged, and we reiterate our Outperform rating on Gilead shares. With the
launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni, we believe Gilead is in the early stages of contributing meaningfully to a major global
public health problem. Combined with strong underlying core global infrastructure in HIV and cardiopulmonary disease
and advancement into the oncology setting, we view the company as poised for a multiyear period of growth and cash
flow generation significantly ahead of its peers. Share price weakness in the aftermarket was likely attributable to
discussion surrounding price discounting, which we believe is 1) in line with expectations for a competitive market with
shortening duration of therapy and 2) considered within the financial guidance framework provided by management.
Based on our revised estimates, the company is trading at 11.2 times our projected EPS in 2015 and a PE/G ratio of 1.0; we
reiterate our Outperform rating on GILD shares.
