HepC price wars worsen, tail comes more quickly; ABBV PT to $73
HepC pricing discounts greater than expected; but volumes higher
On GILD’s 4Q earnings call, management called out a gross to net pricing
discount of 46% in the US in 2015 for their hepC franchise vs. a gross to net
discount of 22% at the end of 2014. This implies pricing of~$50K per cure
for g1 patients vs. our expectations of ~$70K. We had expected hepC
pricing to decline, but the speed of the discounts is far greater then we had
expected. On the positive side, GILD stated that they believe >250K
patients could be treated per year in the US (prior expectations for 200K),
but that means the peak likely comes more quickly (potentially 2016 versus
2017).
More to ABBV than hepC; updating our estimates and price target
We update our global 2016 ABBV hepC estimates to $2.3 bn (from $2.6 bn)
including $1.8 bn for the US market. We maintain our $1.8 bn world wide
forecast for 2015, which is below guidance. Our 2016 estimate assumes
less than 20% market share of g1 patients in the US based on our
assumption of $50K pricing and 250K patients treated per year (around
75% of which are g1 patients). We also update our 12-month price target
to $73 (prior $75). ABBV claims that they weren’t surprised by GILD’s
comments and that their guidance for Viekira assumes “appropriate” gross
to net discounts. However, with greater-than-expected price discounts we
are now more conservative with our hepC estimates.
HepC now out of ABBV’s share price: We calculate ABBV’s $2.3 bn in
HepC sales in 2016 (peak) is worth about $0.85 in EPS (assuming 75%
operating margin). Using a GILD multiple (~10x 2015 EPS) that implies
around $8/share. ABBV shares have already declined $8 since its peak in
early Dec (mostly all based on hepC concerns in our view).
Reiterate Buy: HepC is a small piece to the ABBV story. Even at peak hepC
represents only ~10% of ABBV sales. ABBV’s multiple reflects basically no
growth (12x 2016 vs 16x for pharma) despite 14% EPS CAGR from 2014-
2018 and meaningful pipeline opportunities (eg. ABT-199, Elagolix, etc).
Risk to our MRK estimates; less room for newer competitors
We have MRK sales peaking at $3-4 bn (unrisk adjusted) which looks to be
at risk based on lower pricing for hepC drugs. We believe MRK’s HepC
plan hinges on a long tail and greater opportunity for late entrance.
 
Sachs Global Investment Research
We update our ABBV 12-month price target to $73 (prior $75) based on 17x our 2015E EPS
(lower multiple on lower long-term hepC sales), weighted at 85%, and an unchanged M&A
value of $78, weighted at 15%.
Risk include Humira, product launches (hepC), pipeline and business development.
