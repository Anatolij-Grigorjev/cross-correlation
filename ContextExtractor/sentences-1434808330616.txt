0. HepC price wars worsen , tail comes more quickly ; ABBV PT to $ 73 
HepC pricing discounts greater than expected ; but volumes higher 
On GILD’s 4Q earnings call , management called out a gross to net pricing 
discount of 46 % in the US in 2015 for their hepC franchise vs. a gross to net 
discount of 22 % at the end of 2014 . (SCORE: 277.0237995429334)
3. On the positive side , GILD stated that they believe >250K 
patients could be treated per year in the US ( prior expectations for 200K) , 
but that means the peak likely comes more quickly ( potentially 2016 versus 
2017 ) . (SCORE: 186.7978404654791)
4. More to ABBV than hepC ; updating our estimates and price target 
We update our global 2016 ABBV hepC estimates to $ 2.3 bn ( from $ 2.6 bn ) 
including $ 1.8 bn for the US market . (SCORE: 148.8385554870148)
6. Our 2016 estimate assumes 
less than 20 % market share of g1 patients in the US based on our 
assumption of $ 50K pricing and 250K patients treated per year (around 
75 % of which are g1 patients ) . (SCORE: 163.8573380398613)
10. HepC now out of ABBV’s share price : We calculate ABBV’s $ 2.3 bn in 
HepC sales in 2016 ( peak ) is worth about $ 0.85 in EPS ( assuming 75 % 
operating margin ) . (SCORE: 144.65344476271235)
17. Risk to our MRK estimates ; less room for newer competitors 
We have MRK sales peaking at $ 3-4 bn (unrisk adjusted ) which looks to be 
at risk based on lower pricing for hepC drugs . (SCORE: 177.91676588819635)
19. Sachs Global Investment Research 
We update our ABBV 12-month price target to $ 73 ( prior $ 75 ) based on 17x our 2015E EPS 
( lower multiple on lower long-term hepC sales ) , weighted at 85 % , and an unchanged M&A 
value of $ 78 , weighted at 15 % . (SCORE: 181.22342400701874)
